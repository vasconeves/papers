\abstract{ We present a comparative test of five metallicity calibrations of M dwarfs, from the works of Bonfils et al. (2005), Casagrande et al. (2008), Johnson \& Apps (2009), and Schlaufman \& Laughlin (2010), using  a sample of 20 M dwarf companions with a wide ($>$ 0.5 arcsec) FGK primary. The aim here is to clarify which metallicity calibration should be used when a [Fe/H] estimation of M dwarfs is needed. We conclude that, at present, the best metallicity calibration is from Schlaufman \& Laughlin (2010): it has the lowest offset and does the best job in explaining the variance of the data. We also find out that the use of precise V photometry does not significantly change the final dispersion of the calibrations of Bonfils et al. (2005), Johnson \& Apps (2009), and Schlaufman \& Laughlin (2010). %In the near future, we intend %to test the Rojas-Ayala et al. calibration, to study  the planet-metallicity correlation, and to create a precise ($\sim$ 0.05 dex) metallicity calibration.

\section{Introduction}

%M dwarfs are the smallest and coldest stars of the main sequence. However, they are the most numerous and comprise most of its baryonic matter in the Galaxy. (\textcolor{red}{verificar referencia de Chabrier}). 

In recent times there has been an increased interest in studying M dwarfs, motivated by the fact that it is easier to detect lower mass planets around them. In fact, the lower mass and radius of M dwarfs imply that the reflex velocities induced by planets around them, as well as the transit depths, are considerably larger, when compared to the same effects induced in the more massive, and better studied, FGK stars. Moreover, the habitable zone around these stars are situated in tighter orbits, which makes the detection of planets in this area easier with radial velocity and transit techniques, as both have their best sensitivity closer to the host star (e.g. \citeauthor{Udry-2007b} \citeyear{Udry-2007b}; \citeauthor{Mayor-2009} \citeyear{Mayor-2009}).

%M stars are also increasingly important in the context of planet formation around very low mass stars. Some theoretical models predict that the formation of giant planets is seriously inhibited around the less massive stars (M$_{*} <$ 0.4M$_{\odot}$) (e.g. \citeauthor{Laughlin-2004} \citeyear{Laughlin-2004}; \citeauthor{Ida-2005} \citeyear{Ida-2005}). According to them, the formed rocky or ice cores do not have enough time to get a gas envelope and become super-earths or ice giants instead. Others suggest that the proto-planets may have enough time to grow and to accrete the gas envelope before the disk vanishes, by invoking migration and faster accretion (e.g. \citeauthor{Alibert-2005} \citeyear{Alibert-2005}). Alternatively, \citet{Boss-2006a}, and \citet{Boss-2006b} show that the disk instability hypothesis can also play a role in the formation of planets around M dwarfs. Indeed, an increasingly number of planets are being detected around these stars and they show that most planets have, on average, a lower mass than those found on FGK stars, the majority being Neptunians and super-Earths (e.g. \citeauthor{Bonfils-2007} \citeyear{Bonfils-2007}; \citeauthor{Udry-2007b} \citeyear{Udry-2007b} \textcolor{red}{mais 1 ou 2 referencias aqui}). 

%On the observational side, M dwarfs are under considerable attention as planet hosts: 

The growing number of exoplanets, as well as a copious amount of high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra from their host stars, available from radial velocity surveys, allow the statistical analysis of their properties as well as the properties of their host stars (for a review see \citeauthor{Udry-2007} \citeyear{Udry-2007}). One of the most remarkable correlations found so far for FGK stars that is improving the understanding of the processes of planetary formation is related to the host star: the stars with higher metallicity content have, on average, a higher probability of hosting Jovian class planets (\citeauthor{Gonzalez-1997} \citeyear{Gonzalez-1997}; \citeauthor{Santos-2001a} \citeyear{Santos-2001a}; \citeauthor{Santos-2004b} \citeyear{Santos-2004b}; \citeauthor{Fischer-2005} \citeyear{Fischer-2005}). Whether or not this correlation extends to the cooler M dwarfs is still controversial (e.g.\citeauthor{Bonfils-2005} \citeyear{Bonfils-2005}; \citeauthor{Johnson-2009} \citeyear{Johnson-2009}; \citeauthor{Schlaufman-2010} \citeyear{Schlaufman-2010}) and requires very precise measurements. Interestingly, this correlation is likely not observed for FGK stars orbited by Neptune or Super-Earth type planets (\citeauthor{Sousa-2008} \citeyear{Sousa-2008}; \citeauthor{Bouchy-2009} \citeyear{Bouchy-2009}).

For M dwarfs, however, the measurement of the stellar parameters from their spectra is not a trivial task. As the stellar subtype increases, the number of diatomic and triatomic molecules (e.g. TiO, VO, H$_{2}$O, CO, etc) in the M dwarf atmospheres increase, effectively depressing the continuum and making a line by line spectroscopic analysis impossible for all but the earlier subtypes. \textbf{The lack of atmospheric models with sufficient line and molecular opacities also affects the calculation of the stellar parameters}, limiting the accuracy of their determination. In this context, several attempts at measuring the M dwarf metallicities using different techniques have been recently made as described in detail in the following section.

In this paper, we test the metallicity calibrations of \citet{Bonfils-2005}, \citet{Casagrande-2008}, \citet{Johnson-2009}, and \citet{Schlaufman-2010} using  a sample of 23 M dwarf companions with a wide ($>$ 0.5 arcsec) FGK primary. A description of our sample is done in chapter \ref{sample}. Then, on chapter \ref{test}, we test and compare the different calibrations with our measurements. Finally, on chapter \ref{discussion}, we discuss our results.

\section{The latest metallicity measurements and calibrations}
\label{latest}

In the last few years several attempts have been made at measuring M dwarf metallicities. \citet{Woolf-2005} used measurements of equivalent widths of atomic lines from high resolution spectra of 35 M and K dwarfs, to make a classical spectroscopic analysis as done for FGK dwarfs, but with updated atmospheric models. Unfortunately, this approach is only feasible for the M dwarfs with the earliest ($T_{eff} > 3500$ K), metal-poor subtypes. This study was then extended in \citet{Woolf-2006}, with additional data for 32 stars. The measurements were then used to create a metallicity calibration with molecular indices, namely CaH2 and TiO5, than can be taken from medium resolution spectra ($\lambda/\Delta \lambda \sim 3000$), allowing the quantification of the metallicity on fainter and/or further stars. This calibration has an uncertainty of $\pm$0.30 dex.

\textbf{An alternative approach, introduced by \citet{Bonfils-2005}, is based on the measurement of metallicities from FGK high-resolution spectra in binary or multiple systems where one of the lesser bright stars is an M dwarf. The metallicity of the latter is inferred from the former. Then, a photometric metallicity calibration is established, based on the fact that the V photometry correlates with [Fe/H] whereas the K photometry does not. The metallicity effect of the V band was first suggested by \citet{Delfosse-2000}, and then confirmed by \citet{Bonfils-2005}. \citet{Johnson-2009}, and \citet{Schlaufman-2010} also used a similar technique to create metallicity calibrations for M dwarfs. All calibrations depend on precise parallaxes from the Hipparcos sattelite \citep{Perryman-1997}, and this does mean that these studies are limited to stars in the solar neighbourhood. }

\citet{Bonfils-2005} found that the mean metallicity of M dwarfs with planets is -0.11 dex, which contrast sharply with the value found for FGK stars (+0.15 dex). Moreover, they found that the metallicity of M dwarfs, using the calibration, in their complete, volume limited sample of FGKM dwarfs have a $\sim 0.07$ dex shift toward lower metallicities, \textbf{when compared to the full sample. This may imply that the decreased frequency of Jovians around M dwarfs is a reflection of their lower metallicities rather than their lower masses. }

The high-resolution spectral synthesis is starting to produce its first results for M dwarfs (e.g. \citeauthor{Valenti-1998} \citeyear{Valenti-1998}, \citeauthor{Bean-2006} \citeyear{Bean-2006}). However, the technique does not yet reproduce all the fine details of a high-resolution spectra, due to a lack of the proper opacities and molecular transitions for the used model atmospheres. \citet{Bean-2006} used this technique to determine precise stellar parameters of M dwarfs. He found that the uncertainties regarding the determination of metallicity were around 0.12 dex. However, this value does not take into account systematic errors or errors that may come from the models. %Therefore, the results of this work should be taken with care.

A completely different technique was devised by \citet{Casagrande-2008} based on his previous study of FGK stars using the infrared flux method \citep{Casagrande-2006}. In order to adapt this method to M dwarfs, optical bands were added, creating the so-called MOITE, Multiple Optical and Infrared TEchnique.  The calculated metallicities have a very good agreement with \citet{Bonfils-2005} results. The internal uncertainties are reported as $\sim$ 0.2 dex and the total uncertainty is estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.3 dex.

In a more recent study, \citet{Johnson-2009} tested the \citet{Bonfils-2005} calibration. They created an empirical model using a color-magnitude diagram, in which the vertical distance of the M dwarf to the mean metallicity of the main sequence M stars (equal to the mean metallicity of a volume limited sample of FGK stars from the SPOCS sample \citep{Valenti-2005}) is a measure of the star metallicity. Their results suggest that the metal rich stars of \citet{Bonfils-2005} are systematically underestimated, by an average of 0.32 dex, attributing this to a lack of metal rich stars in their sample or due to the use of poor V magnitudes. They conclude that M dwarf planet hosts follow the same trend as FGK stars, that is, they are preferentially metal rich. They also suggest that the lack of Jovian planets around M dwarfs is mostly correlated to a lower stellar mass and not to a lower value of [Fe/H], being more consistent with the works of planetary formation around M stars (i.e. \citeauthor{Laughlin-2004} \citeyear{Laughlin-2004}; \citeauthor{Ida-2005} \citeyear{Ida-2005}).

\textbf{Following the work of \citet{Johnson-2009}, \citet{Schlaufman-2010} created a very similar calibration but using a volume-limited and kinematically matched sample to test if the value found for the mean M dwarf main sequence metallicity using FGK primaries (with M dwarf secondaries) were compatible with each other. They conclude that both samples are statistically indistinguishable.

%, the Geneva-Copenhagen survey \citep{Nordstrom-2004}. They claim that this catalogue is more unbiased and outlier-sensitive when compared to other catalogues, having a mean MS metallicity value for the M dwarfs of -0.14 dex as opposed to -0.05 dex of \citet{Johnson-2009}. 
Using models from \citet{Baraffe-1998}, they show that the metallicity correlates best with horizontal shifts in the $V-K_{s}$,$M_{K_{s}}$ plane. For this reason, they compute the distance from the M dwarf main sequence to the M dwarf star only in the horizontal direction. Their results show that the previous calibrations underestimate \citep{Bonfils-2005} or overestimate \citep{Johnson-2009} metallicity at the extremes of their range. They conclude that their results suggest that metal rich M dwarfs are more likely to host planets, as in FGK stars, and they claim that there is a hint that this correlation might extend to low-mass planets as well. This last result is in opposition to results obtained for low-mass planets orbiting FGK stars, which state that there is no significative relation between metallicity and the existence of low-mass planets (e.g. \citeauthor{Udry-2007b} \citeyear{Udry-2007b}; \citeauthor{Sousa-2008} \citeyear{Sousa-2008})


Finally, \citet{Rojas-Ayala-2010} recently released a new paper describing a novel and very precise technique that allows an easier observation of late type M dwarfs as well as farther/fainter, stars. Their technique is based on the calculation of spectral indices via direct spectral analysis of moderate ($R \sim 2700$) near infrared spectra (K band), and has the advantage of not depending on V magnitudes nor parallaxes, allowing the study of fainter (or/and farther) stars. They report uncertainties of $\pm 0.15$ dex. Their results agree in general with \citet{Johnson-2009} and \citet{Schlaufman-2010} that M dwarf planet hosts appear to be systematically metal rich, a result consistent with the [Fe/H] distribution of FGK stars with planets. Neptunian host stars also seem to follow the trend of FGK stars, having a lower metallicity than Jovian hosts.




%A classical spectroscopic analysis gets more difficult with the increase of the spectral subtype, as the number of several diatomic and triatomic molecules. 

%During the last few years there have been several attempts at creating a metallicity calibration for M dwarfs. Establishing such calibration is important

Our testing sample, shown in Table \ref{estrelas}, is composed of 20 M dwarf secondaries with FGK companions. The selection of the binaries/multiples was made using the \citet{Gliese-1991} catalogue of nearby stars, the \citet{Poveda-1994} catalogue of wide-binary and multiple systems of nearby stars,  the \citet{Gould-2004} list of physical HIPPARCOS binaries, the \citet{Chaname-2004} disk and halo binaries from the Revised Luyten Catalog, and the \citet{Chaname-2007} catalogue of wide binaries. We chose only systems whose components have wide ($>$ 5 arcsec) separations, in order to avoid light contamination from the primaries,  and matching proper motions. Care was taken not to include fast rotators, spectroscopic binaries, and stars without proper motions into our sample.



The Johnson-Cousins VRI photometry of the M dwarfs was taken mainly from \citet{Mermilliod-1997}. The JHK$_{S}$ photometry was taken from 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie-2006} except in the case of Gl 551 \citep{Bessell-1991}. We only use precise V photometry, with average uncertainties around 0.02 mag. Ten RI photometry sources were in a different system other than Johnson-Cousins and had to be converted. The Weistrop and Kron photometries were converted into the Johnson-Cousins system using the transformations from \citet{Weistrop-1975} and \citet{Leggett-1992} respectively. All parallaxes, measured from the primaries, were taken from the new reduction of the astrometric data from the HIPPARCOS satellite \citep{van_Leeuwen-2007}.



The metallicity for the secondaries was obtained from high-resolution spectra of the primaries. Two methods were followed to determine the [Fe/H]: the first method, used for the majority of the stars, consists in the calculation of the stellar parameters of the star, following the procedure described in \citet{Santos-2004b}, by imposing excitation and ionization equilibrium. The Fe lines were measured using the program ARES \citep{Sousa-2007} with the Fe line list of \citet{Sousa-2007}. A grid of Kurucz model atmospheres \citep{Kurucz-1993} is also used in this process, as well as the radiative transfer program MOOG \citep{Sneden-1973}. The parameters that were determined by this method are described in Table \ref{parameters}. Nine [Fe/H] values calculated with the same method were taken from  \citet{Bonfils-2005} (five stars) and \citet{Sousa-2008} (four stars).; the second method, used for four stars, is based on the determination of the metallicity from the cross correlation function, as described by \citet{Santos-2002a}. 

\textbf{The first method used spectra taken with the FEROS spectrograph\footnote{installed on the 2.2-m ESO/MPI telescope, La Silla ESO Observatory, Chile} \citep{Kaufer-1998}, under the ESO program XXXX.XXXX. These spectra have a resolution of $\sim$ 48.000 and a signal-to-noise ratio ranging from $\sim$ XX to $\sim$ XX. Spectra from the CORALIE\footnote{installed on the 1.20m Euler Swiss telescope, La Silla ESO Observatory, Chile} \citep{Queloz-2000} and SOPHIE\footnote{installed on the 1.93m telescope of the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France} spectrographs \citep{Bouchy-2006} were used to derivate [Fe/H] values using the second method. CORALIE spectra have a resolution of $\sim$ 50.000 and a signal-to-noise ratio from $\sim$ XX to $\sim$ XX, while the SOPHIE spectra have a resolution of $\sim$ 75.000 or 40.000 ??? and an average signal-to-noise of $\sim$ XX.  }

The full references for all parameters are listed in Table \ref{estrelas}. 






\section{The test}
\label{test}



The calibration tests consist in the comparison between the metallicities obtained from the FGK companions of the M dwarfs and the results from each of the metallicity calibrations, namely, the two \citet{Bonfils-2005} calibrations (hereafter B05(1) for the V-K,M$_{K}$ calibration, and B05(2) for the mass calibration), the \citet{Casagrande-2008} (hereafter C08), the \citet{Johnson-2009} (hereafter JA09), and \citet{Schlaufman-2010} (hereafter SL10) calibrations. The values of the calibrations were calculated from their respective expressions (see Table \ref{stats}) except in the case of the \citet{Casagrande-2008} calibration, where no expression is available: the metallicity values were kindly provided by Luca Casagrande, using the VRIJHK$_{S}$ photometry from this paper.

We did two tests. In the first one we calculated several parameters for each calibration: the offset, rms, RMS$_{p}$ and R$^{2}_{ap}$. The RMS$_{p}$, and R$^{2}_{ap}$ are, respectively, the residual mean square and the adjusted square of the multiple correlation coefficient, as described in the \citet{Schlaufman-2010} paper. A lower value of RMS$_{p}$ means that the model being tested is best suited for prediction, while a R$^{2}_{ap}$ closer to 1 signifies that the tested model explains most of the variance of the data. The values for these parameters are shown in Table \ref{stats}. 

The second test consisted in a bootstrap analysis where we made 10.000 trials using, for each trial, 68 \% (1 $\sigma$) of randomly chosen data points from the full sample. Then, we calculated the average of the quantities described in the first test. The results for this test are described in Table \ref{bootstrap}.

Following the plots from Fig. \ref{fehfeh} and Table \ref{stats} we can observe that all calibrations fit the data reasonably well, except in the case of C08 and JA09. These calibrations suffer from a big offset (-0.14 and 0.13 dex, respectively). The C08 calibration has also the worst rms, RMS$_{p}$ and R$^{2}_{ap}$ values. \textbf{The negative R$^{2}_{ap}$ value of the calibrations of C08 and JA09 means that the used models are increasing the variance when compared to a constant model}. On the other hand, the B05(1) and the SL10 calibration have similar values of rms and RMS$_{p}$. However, regarding the offset and the R$^{2}_{ap}$ values, the SL10 calibration has lower values (0.01 dex and 0.30 respectively) that the one from B05(1) calibration (0.09 dex and 0.23 respectively). This suggests that the best calibration for our sample is the one of SL10 and that this model is the best suited for prediction as well as explaining the variance of the data. 

The results of the bootstrap analysis, depicted in Table \ref{bootstrap}, show that the offset, rms, and RMS$_{p}$ values are robust, with only a small variation around the mean value, and equal or very similar to the ones obtained from the analysis of the full sample. The bootstrap analysis confirms that the SL10 is best calibration so far for predicting metallicities of M dwarfs. However, the R$^{2}_{ap}$ standard deviation values imply a large variation of this parameter when using different sub-samples. This may mean that this parameter is not well suited for explaining the goodness-of-fit of a model, at least for small samples. Nevertheless, the SL10 model is confirmed to be the best, having the highest mean R$^{2}_{ap}$ value (0.27) with the lowest dispersion (0.20). 

\textbf{We must note, however, that all calibrations seem to overestimate the metallicity for spectroscopic [Fe/H] $< -0.4$. Unfortunately, we only have one star in this region, but there is a hint that there may be a trend with a negative slope as a function of the spectroscopic metallicity in all the lower panels of Fig. \ref{fehfeh}. We do not know the cause for this trend. Regarding higher metallicities, above 0.2 dex, only the calibrations of JA09 and SL10 seem to accurately predict the spectroscopic metallicities: all the other calibrations underestimate the [Fe/H] value. }




%Regarding the remaining calibrations, the best one is the one from Sl10, which has a very small offset (-0.02 dex) and the smallest $rms$ value (0.19 dex) of all calibrations. The calibration of SL10 has the smallest value of $RMSp$ and $R^{2}_{ap}$. This means that this model is best suited for prediction as well as the best in explaining the variance of the data. This trends can be seen more clearly in Figs. \ref{residuals} and \ref{fehfeh}.

%The results also show that the B05(1) and JA09 models respectively underestimate and overestimate the metallicity in the limits of their range, as it is clearly seen in Fig. \ref{fehfeh} in accordance with the findings of \citet{Schlaufman-2010}. 


\textit{SL10 reports that the BO5(1) calibration has a R$^{2}_{ap}$ value lower than 0.05. Our findings, however, show that the BO5(1) model can explain the variance of the data much better than that, with a R$^{2}_{ap}$ value of 0.23, whereas the value of SL10 is 0.30. Therefore, the statement of SL10 that their model explains almost an order of magnitude more of the variance of the calibration sample, relative to the B05(1) model, is not confirmed.}

The calibration of \citet{Rojas-Ayala-2010} is reported as having a RMS$_{p}$ of only 0.02 and an R$^{2}_{ap} = 0.63$, with a dispersion of only 0.15 dex. Therefore, it would be very interesting to test it. Unfortunately, we were not able to do it because we lack the infrared spectra to measure the spectral indexes.   We were able to do an external test, by comparing the measurements of the five stars in common (Gl 212, Gl 231.1B, Gl 250B, Gl 324B, and Gl 797B , with predicted [Fe/H] of 0.09, -0.05, -0.04, 0.3, and -0.09 dex respectively). We got a value of only 0.06 dex for the dispersion and a 0.01 dex offset between the spectroscopic measurements and \citet{Rojas-Ayala-2010} predicted metallicities. These numbers have little significance, but they may give a hint that the calibration is compatible with the spectroscopic measurements.

\section {Discussion}
\label{discussion}

In this paper we tested the metallicity calibrations of \citet{Bonfils-2005}, \citet{Johnson-2009}, \citet{Casagrande-2008}, and \citet{Schlaufman-2010}, using precise metallicity determinations from binary/multiple systems and precise VRIJHK$_{S}$ photometry. We conclude that, at present, the best calibration for M dwarfs is the one from \citet{Schlaufman-2010}: it has the lowest zero-point offset, dispersion, RMS$_{P}$ and has the highest R$^{2}_{ap}$. Unfortunately we were not unable to test the \citet{Rojas-Ayala-2010} calibration. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny if this calibration is better than the one of \citet{Schlaufman-2010}. However, our limited external test with five stars is encouraging and suggests that this calibration should be properly tested. 

The impact of the precision of V photometry on the final precision of some of the calibrations (B05, JA09, SL10) have been recently discussed. In this paper we use precise V photometry, with an average precision of $\sim$ 0.02 mag, and conclude that the use of precise photometry does not impact the final dispersion of the mentioned calibrations: there is not a significant decrease of the obtained rms when compared to the dispersion reported in the original papers. 

The precise determination of metallicities of M dwarfs is very important in the understanding of the formation and evolution of planets around very low mass stars, as well as for studies about the star-planet connection. Some questions are left unanswered, such as which of the two parameters, [Fe/H] or mass, are the most important in the planet formation around M dwarfs, or whether the relation between the higher frequency of planets around stars that are richer in [Fe/H] is true for M stars or not. In order to answer these questions, a more precise metallicity determination is needed, either by doing a better calibration, or by exploring other approaches, such as using spectral indexes, like \citet{Woolf-2006}, and \citet{Rojas-Ayala-2010}, or by finding a way to directly measure the stellar parameters of M dwarfs, either empirically (e.g. \citeauthor{Woolf-2005} \citeyear{Woolf-2005}) or by using synthetic spectra (e.g. \citeauthor{Bean-2006} \citeyear{Bean-2006}). 

In the near future, we aim to create a photometric metallicity calibration that can reach a precision of the order of $\sim$ 0.05 dex, as well as finding new ways to directly determine the metallicity and other parameters (such as effective temperature) from the M dwarf spectra. In this paper we did not address the planet-metallicity correlation, but we intend to do it in the future.
