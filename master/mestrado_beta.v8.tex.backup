%\begin{abstract}
%In this work, we present an uniform study of the chemical abundances of 12 elements (Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Na, Mg and Al) in the 451 stars of the HARPS GTO planet search program, from which 66 stars are known to have planetary companions. We have tested our results against those found in the literature. The main goal of this study is the investigation of the possible differences between the abundances of the stars with and without planets. We have confirmed that there is an overabundance of metallicity in planet host stars, common to all species, as expected. We have also found that there is no difference in the trends of the stars with and without planets. The stars that harbour planetary companions simply seem to be in the high metallicity tail of the distribution. We have only found one case of clear overabundance for a fixed [Fe/H] (HD147513) where the pollution scenario might be important.This particular star needs to be investigated in a future work. We also need to explore the possibility of the existence of a different population of stars with higher metallicity in the region of [Fe/H] < 0 that was detected in the plots of [X/Fe] vs [Fe/H].

\section{In the Beginning...}

Since immemorial times man has asked himself if he was alone in the Universe. If there was life elsewhere beyond Earth. If there were places out there where sentient beings could live and wonder about the same questions...who are we? where do we came from? where are we going...?
%habitable planets orbiting other stars, after realising that the tiny specks of light scattered across the sky were stars similar to our own.

When the first exoplanet around a solar type star, 51 Peg b, was discovered, by \citet{Mayor-1995}, %\textcolor {red} {when it's host star spectra was gathered after light years of relentless travel through the dark void among the stars},
a first, tiny piece of the huge puzzle that could answer these ages old questions was put into place. This discovery turned out to be one of the biggest breakthroughs in astrophysics of all times and sent shock waves that rippled through the teeming masses of humanity: there are other planetary systems in the Universe beyond our own...what next?

\indent Although this discovery and the others that followed shortly (e.g. \citeauthor{Marcy-1996} \citeyear{Marcy-1996}) had only detected giant planets with masses of the order of magnitude of Jupiter, the seed of possibilities had already been casted and the impact of these discoveries not only  opened a new field in astrophysics but also the minds and imagination of everyone. They have inspired passionate debates and, suddenly, old questions arrived renewed. Are there other Earths orbiting other stars? Is life exclusive to Earth or is it common throughout the galaxy and the universe? Does this life, if it really exists, evolved and gained intelligence? And so on. 

Unfortunately, it does take endless hours of painstaking research and perseverance to reach for even the smallest answer. And then many more questions follow...that's how Science works! But let us now change subjects and move on to more practical questions: the techniques that allowed the discovery of the exoplanet systems around solar type stars and their characterisation.

%To conclude, we would like to suggest some reviews about the statistical results of exoplanet characteristics made by \citet{Udry-2007c} and \citet{Udry-2007}. - COLOCAR ISTO NA PARTE DAS PROPRIEDADES ESTATISTICAS

\section{The Radial Velocity Technique}

Those first discoveries, and most of the exoplanets that are found nowadays ($\sim 94\%$), are based in the radial velocity (RV) technique. The use of this technique to detect planetary bodies was first proposed by \citet{Struve-1952}. It consists in the detection of the Doppler shift produced in the star's spectrum  by the subtle 'wobbling' of the star due to the presence of a planet in its orbit. If the star is moving toward Earth its light will be shifted to the 'blue' (i.e. the spectral lines will move to shorter wavelengths). However, if the star is moving away from Earth its light will be red-shifted (i.e. the lines will move to longer wavelengths). This is illustrated in Fig. \ref{rvpic}a. The radial velocity of the star can then be deduced from the displacement of the spectral lines. In Fig. \ref{rvpic}b we can see such variation depicting the orbital motion of a star. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption[The RV Technique illustration and plots]{a) Illustration showing how the radial velocity technique works. Credits: www.nasa.gov; b) Plots of radial velocity as function of the orbital phase, showing the orbital motion of 51 Peg at four different epochs \citep{Mayor-1995}.}
\label{rvpic}
\end{figure}

With the RV technique we can only ascertain with relative precision some orbital parameters (the semi major axis of the planet's orbit, eccentricity and orbital period) and a lower limit of the planet's mass. We cannot obtain the exact value of the mass because we lack the value of the inclination of the orbit of the planet to the line perpendicular to the line of sight. This fact is clearly expressed by the so called mass function,
\begin{equation}
 f(m)=\frac{(m \sin i)^3}{(M+m)^2}=1.036\times10^{-7}K^2(1-e)^{3/2}P\,\,\, [M_\odot]
\label {vradial}
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $M$ is the planet and star mass, respectively, both expressed in solar masses, $i$ the inclination, $e$ the eccentricity, $K$ the measured semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, given in km/s, and $P$ the measured period of the star's wobble (that is equal to the planet's orbital period around the star), given in days. The $P$, $e$ and $K$ can be directly obtained from the RV curve. The $m \sin i$ is then calculated with this equation. For a detailed demonstration refer to \citet{Santos-2008}. From Eq. (\ref{vradial}) we can clearly see that the amplitude of the radial velocity will be greater if the planet is closer and/or is more massive. This means that planets with smaller masses and further away from the star will be more difficult do detect. 

The RV technique does not give us the attributes for the planet radius and is unsuitable to detect planets in stars that are too massive, instable or rotate too rapidly. Therefore, the detection of planets with it is restricted to 'quiet' FGKM dwarf stars. If we want to acquire the radius and, with it, the mean density of the planet, we need to use other techniques such as photometric transits or astrometry and combine the data of the two methods.

Nevertheless, the RV technique is far from having reached its highest point: It is expected that the precision can reach a limit of 1 cm/s, enabling the detection of sub Earth planets \citep{Lovis-2006b}. 


%Using Kepler's third law, the period of the planet's orbit around a star (that is equal to the variation of the star's wobble) can be used to determine the distance of the planet to the star, 
%\begin{equation}
% r^3=\frac{GM_{star}}{4\pi^2}P_{star}^2,
%\end{equation}
%where $r$ is the radius of the planet, $G$ the gravitational constant, $M_{star}$ the mass of the star and %$P_{star}$ the observed period of the star's wobble.

%The mass limit is due to the unknown value of the inclination of the orbit of the planet relative to the star, [ver %wikidopplerspectroscopy]
%\begin {equation}
%\label {eq 1.1}
%M_{p}=
%\end {equation}
%, where $M_{pl}$ is the planet's Mass, 

\section{The Photometric Transit Technique}
\label{transit}
A photometric transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of its host star and blocks part of its light. 
The photometric transit technique consists in the measurement of the variation of the star's brightness at the moment of the transit. For a Jupiter like planet, the brightness of the star is reduced by $\sim 1\%$ and for less massive planets the variation is even smaller \citep{Santos-2008}. %that drops by a small amount.

This technique can only detect orbits of planets closely aligned with Earth. The estimated probability that a full transit will happen is given by the geometric probability, $P=R_{star}/a$, where $R_{star}$ and $a$ are the stellar and orbital radius, respectively. This formula is an approximation and is only valid for near-circular orbits. While the probability of detecting a planet with an orbital period of 3 days is about 10\%, it goes down to 0.5\% for a planet orbiting 1 AU\footnote{Astronomical Unit} from its star.

Another disadvantage relates to its high rate of false detections, where changes in the brightness of the star are induced by other phenomena such as eclipsing binaries, grazing stellar eclipses or variations in the chromospheric activity (false detections). Therefore, the only way to be sure that a positive detection was achieved is to do a follow up with RV. 

The greatest advantage of the transit technique is that we can determine the radius of the planet from the light-curve. We can see an example of a phototransit event in Fig. \ref{photot}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 0.5cm 0cm 0.4cm,clip,height=5 cm]{pics/phototransit}
\caption[Example of a phototransit event]{Photometric time series, binned into 5 minute averages. The solid line represents the best fit for data. The dashed lines represent transit curves if the transit planet had $\pm10\%$ in size. From \citet{Charbonneau-2000}.}
\label{photot}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, we cannot acquire the mass of the planet with this technique alone. However, if we combine the information obtained in RV with the one obtained in a photometric transit \citep{Charbonneau-2000}, we can determine the exact mass and the mean density of the planet.

%It is also possible to study the chemical abundances of a transiting planet's atmosphere by comparing the spectra of its star before and during the transit. The first detection of the signature of Sodium in HD 209458b, a hot Jupiter, was accomplished by \citet{Charbonneau-2002}, and the signature of Carbon and Oxygen was discovered in the same planet by \citet{Vidal-Madjar-2004}. Both groups used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to make the detections.

The future of the transit technique is most promising: today, dozens of surveys are made and the possibility to study the density and atmospheric composition of the planets is within reach. Higher expectations came from the space based missions, both present (COROT) and future (Kepler): they may allow the detection of Earth size or even smaller planets. In conjunction with RV it will be possible to study the 'Earth domain' mass-radius relation.

\section{Astrometry}
\label{astrometry}
Astrometry is the oldest searching method for detecting extrasolar planets but not the most effective (yet). It consists in the very precise measuring of a star's position against the background over time. The presence of another sufficiently orbiting massive body will make the detection of the star's motion around the centre of mass of the system possible. The first confirmation of an exoplanet with this method was made by \citet{Benedict-2002}, using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

Unfortunately, current astrometric technology does not allow the detection of planetary bodies from scratch: up to now, all detections made with astrometry were follow-ups to successfull measurements with RV. It will be needed to surpass the 1 micro-arc-second threshhold for an independent and reliable detection of planetary bodies with astrometry.

In conjunction with RV, it gives the exact mass of the planet, along with astrometric parameters (perturbation of the semimajor axis, inclination and absolute parallax). Astrometry is also complementary of RV in the sense that it is more sensitive to longer period planets. On the top of that, it enables the detection of companions in stars where RV is impracticable: A,B stars and T-Tauri stars.

Regarding astrometry, the space missions HST and the James Webb Space Telescope and the ground-based mission Very Large Telescope Interferometer will enable the gathering of astrometric parameters from planetary systems and allow the determination of the exact mass of the planetary companions. Further in the future, the space missions GAIA and SIM will, hopefully, detect thousands of planets by pushing the detection limits toward sub Earth mass planets.



\section{Microlensing} 
\label{microlens}
\indent In this context we should not forget the role of a promising technique, microlensing \citep{Beaulieu-2006}, also very complementary of RV, with the potential of detecting sub earth mass bodies in long period orbits. Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light from distant stars. If the star that provokes the lensing has a planet, then the planet's field might make a detectable contribution. One example can be seen in Fig. \ref{microlensfig}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 0.5cm 0cm 0.5cm,clip,height=5 cm]{pics/microlensing2}
\caption[Example of a microlensing event]{Observed light curve of the OGLE-2005-BLG-390 microlensing event and best-fit model plotted as a function of time. From \citet{Beaulieu-2006}.}
\label{microlensfig}
\end{figure}

We can estimate the mass, period and semimajor axis of the planet with this method. However, it has a great disadvantage: the lensing is difficult to reproduce because the chance alignment may never occur again. Moreover, the detected planets need to be far away from us, typically in the galactic bulge, which makes follow up by other methods impossible with the present technology (i.e. RV, Astrometry).

All methods of planetary detection, present and future, along with future ground and space based missions can be reviewed in \citet{Perryman-2005}.



%Considering the stellar properties, further studies on metallicity will be conducted on the new found systems. It will be most interesting to see how the trends in metal poor stars and Solar System similars will develop. - VAI PARA A PARTE DOS METAIS



%\section {Spectra from other worlds - removido} 

%\indent Against all expectations, the transit technique also allowed the first detection of the signature of Sodium, Carbon and Oxygen in HD 209458b, a hot Jupiter, with the Hubble Space Telescope $(HST)$ \textcolor{green}{(Charbonneau et al 2002)}. In 2007, it was discovered the first clear sign of water vapor, also on a hot Jupiter, HD 189733b \textcolor{green}{(Tinetti et al (nature VER))}. The detection of methane followed a few months ago \textcolor{green}{[referencia...]}. This means that we can now detect some elements that are precursors of life as we know it...the firsts steps towards detecting life in another world. 

%However, the discovery sought by all is an earth type planet capable of supporting life. The smallest planet yet discovered is GJ 581c \textcolor{green}{(Udry et al. (2007))} with a minimum mass of 5 earth masses and a estimated radius of 1.5 earth radius. This planet was detected by $RV$ and it's on the limit of the detection. But that's not all: this 'super-earth' resides inside the habitable zone of that star. It would be of great interest to detect a transit of this world in order to acquire his spectra. Nevertheless, we will have more data regarding this and other interesting planets very soon, with the upcoming ground and space missions \textcolor{green}{(see Perryman et al. 2005)}.

\section {A Statistical 'Zoo' of Exoplanets}

Up to now, and according to `The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia\footnote{\textit{http://www.exoplanet.eu/catalog.php} (on 16/06/2008)}', there are 289 planet candidates detected in 252 planetary systems\footnote{excluding the pulsar systems with planets detected by pulsar timing}. The system with the greatest number of planetary bodies found is 55 Cancri, with 5 planets \citep{Fischer-2008} and the smallest planet yet discovered is MOA-2007-BLG-192-Lb \citep{Bennett-2008} with a mass around 3.3 Earth masses.

When we glimpse briefly into this data, we can admire the real 'zoo' that exoplanets have become: orbiting stars of spectral types from F to M, minimum masses from 5 M$_{\oplus}$\footnote{Earth masses} to 20 M$_J$\footnote{Jupiter masses}, periods from a little over of 1 day to 5218 days and eccentricities from perfect circular orbits to extreme values of more than 0.90. There are planets as close as 0.0177 AU and as far as 670 AU from their host stars.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 0.3cm 0cm 0.4cm,clip,height=9 cm]{pics/massplanet3}
\caption[Period Mass distributions of known extrasolar planets ]{Plot of Period-Mass distribution of known exoplanets orbiting solar type stars. The black dots, red squares and green stars represent planets around single stars, planets in binaries and solid planets, respectively. The gray dashed lines represent a limit at 2.25 M$_{J}$ and 100 days. The blue dotted line connects the two massive bodies orbiting HD 168433. The parentheses indicate the position of the probable brown dwarf HD 162020 \citep{Udry-2007}. }
\label{planetmass}
\end{figure}

This information can be of great help in setting tighter constraints to planetary formation models. With this in mind, we can analyse the distributions of the eccentricities, periods and planetary masses and try to relate them among each other and with other measured parameters like the host star properties (chemical composition, effective temperature, surface gravity, mass, age). 

For instance, an illustration of the Period-Mass distribution of the known extrasolar planets orbiting solar type stars can be seen in Fig \ref{planetmass}. We can clearly observe that there is a lack of massive planets in short period orbits. If we exclude multiple systems we can see that there is no planet with a mass greater than 2 M$_{J}$ at all in orbits shorter than 100 days. This might be a consequence of a migration process or a mass transfer (or even absorption) of planets into the star \citep[e.g.][]{Trilling-1998}. %Another interesting aspect is the fact that massive planets prefer to reside farther from the star. This can be explained by the fact that they have more planetesimals to aggregate along a longer orbit. Thus they can grow more \citep{Pollack-1996}. Then, they tend to became 'stranded' due to their larger size and lack of enough material to overcome their inertia.
 
\section {The Formation of Planetary Systems}
\label {planets}
\indent Despite all this bounty of data, we still have a cloudy view of the physical mechanisms behind the formation of planetary systems. The appearance of giant planets close to the star and the existence of bodies with high eccentricity completely changed the way simulations were made. Quite simply, these cases never appeared in the computational models because the constraints used in the possible scenarios were based only on our Solar System...

Nowadays, there are two major theories about the formation of giant planets: core accretion and direct gravitational instability. 

The first one tells us that planets are formed via accretion of dust grains. They continuously grow and collide with each other until they form planetesimals, with a few kilometers in diameter. These bodies continue to grow and collide until they reach bigger sizes, over the course of a few million years. If the mass of a protoplanet reaches 10 to 15 $M_{\oplus}$ before the dispersion of the disk of gas, a runaway accretion will follow and a gas giant will form. On the contrary, if the mass doesn't reach the critical value necessary for runaway accretion, a smaller rocky planet or Neptune type planet will form (\citeauthor{Pollack-1996} \citeyear{Pollack-1996}; \citeauthor{Alibert-2006} \citeyear{Alibert-2006}). 

The second one states that planets form by disk instability: the solar nebula breaks up, through its own self gravity, into clumps of gas and dust, rapidly forming protoplanetary bodies. They are expected to be massive gas giants, forming really fast with  $\tau\sim10^3$ years compared to the accretion time of $\tau\sim10^6$ years in an optimistic scenario \citep{Boss-1997}. 

The planets could then migrate or remain more or less in the location of formation. This will depend mainly on planet-disk interactions \citep{Trilling-1998}.

The metallicity also seems to play an importante role. This will be shown in more detail in subsection \ref{metal}.

%\section{The host star properties}
\section{The Host Star Chemical Properties}

In this section, we will discuss the chemical properties of the planet host stars. As we will see, these properties are providing important clues about the formation of planetary systems and its constraints.

\subsection {The Metallicity Distribution} 
\label{metal}
The analysis of the properties of stars with giant planets have revealed that a giant planet has a much higher probability to be found around stars that have, on average, a higher metallicity, at least for [Fe/H] above the solar value (e.g. \citeauthor{Gonzalez-1998} \citeyear{Gonzalez-1998}; \citeauthor{Gonzalez-2001} \citeyear{Gonzalez-2001}; \citeauthor{Laws-2003} \citeyear{Laws-2003}; \citeauthor{Santos-2001a} \citeyear{Santos-2001b}, \citeyear{Santos-2001a}, \citeyear{Santos-2003}, \citeyear{Santos-2004b}, \citeyear{Santos-2005a}; \citeauthor{Fischer-2005} \citeyear{Fischer-2005}). It was also shown that this result is not biased  (e.g. \citeauthor{Santos-2003} \citeyear{Santos-2003}, \citeyear{Santos-2004b}; \citeauthor{Fischer-2005} \citeyear{Fischer-2005}). This means that metallicity has a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planets (at least for the giant ones). Interestingly enough, it seems that for low metallicities, the frequency of planets may remain constant \citep{Santos-2004b}. In Fig. \ref{histfeh}, we can see two histograms of the frequency of planet hosts with [Fe/H], where this behaviour is evident.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 0.3cm 0cm 0.5cm,clip,height=10 cm]{pics/fehhist}
\caption[Histograms of Frequency of planets with metallicity ]{a) Percentage of planet hosts with stellar metallicity from CORALIE (blue) and Lick-Keck (red) samples. The lowest metallicity part of the histogram has few planet hosts and therefore its statistics are poor.; b) Average distribution of the two samples. The blue curve represents a power law fit of the data using only the [Fe/H] values greater than 0.0. The red line represents an average value for [Fe/H] between -0.5 and 0.0. \citep{Udry-2007}.}
\label{histfeh}
\end{figure}

For Neptune class planets no such clear trend is observed. However, there aren't enough planets yet to make a sound statistical distribution (\citeauthor{Udry-2006} \citeyear{Udry-2006}, \citeauthor{Sousa-2008} \citeyear{Sousa-2008}).

Shortly after this crucial observation, two different hypothesis for this 'anomalous' metallicity arose: the primordial origin and the external pollution process. 

The first one defends that the high metal content of the star originated from the primordial cloud that gave origin to the planetary system. The detected metallicity is seen as nothing more than a consequence of the gallactic chemical evolution. The host stars are simply in the high metallicity end of the distribution. This scenario was favoured in some recent studies (e.g. \citeauthor{Sadakane-2002} \citeyear{Sadakane-2002}; \citeauthor{Santos-2003} \citeyear{Santos-2003}, \citeyear{Santos-2005a}; \citeauthor{Fischer-2005} \citeyear{Fischer-2005}; \citeauthor{Ecuvillon-2006b} \citeyear{Ecuvillon-2006b}). 

The second one posits that the high metallicity found in some stars is due to the late accretion of planetary material. Some evidence was found for this latter scenario: hints of pollution were discovered by \citet{Gonzalez-1998} in the 16 Cyg system in the form of an iron enhancement. This was later confirmed by \citet{Laws-2001}. However, \citet{Santos-2001b} had noticed that the quantity of iron that is needed to explain the higher metallicity of a solar type star with this scenario is often much higher than expected, especially if we consider pollution as the dominant factor in the determination of the stellar metallicity. 

These two mechanisms leave different imprints: in the former case, the star formed in a high metallicity cloud will be fully metal rich; in the latter case, the high metallicity is confined to the stellar convective zone but its interior is left metal poor. In this context, it is important to emphasise that F dwarfs with relatively thin convective zones should exhibit a greater degree of pollution \citep{Fischer-2005}. Therefore, the upper part of the distribution of metal abundance of a F dwarf should exceed the highest value of G dwarfs. This was not observed. On the other hand, this pollution might dillute with the passage of time, mixing with deeper, unenriched layers \citep{Vauclair-2004}. Moreover, giant stars with planets, despite having larger convective envelopes, do not present a lower metallicity when compared to planet host stars similar to the Sun \citep{Ecuvillon-2006b}. A study on the abundances of elements other than iron might give us clues on this important question (see subsection \ref{others}).

It is true that pollution can be important in a few isolated cases. However, the most accepted view today is that pollution is only responsible for a small part in the global metallicity of the star.

This result has important implications for planetary formation theories. As we have seen in Section \ref {planets}, there are two main models of planetary formation: core accretion and gravitational instability. The former predicts that the efficiency of planetary formation depends on metallicity. The latter doesn't \citep{Boss-2002}. The fact that the probability of finding a giant planet increases with [Fe/H] thus favours the core accretion model. This dependence can even be predicted by current models \citep{Ida-2004a}. However, it is not fully known how an increase in the metallicity will change the parameters that reign over the formation and evolution of planets. 


%These results may have important consequences in the constraining of the parameters for the computational models of planetary systems (\citet{Pollack-1996}, \citet{Boss-2002}).

\subsection {Abundance of other Elements} %***
\label {others}

For some time the spectroscopic studies were almost restricted to the measurement of the iron abundance ([Fe/H]) that acted as a metallicity proxy. Then, works on the abundance of other elements ([X/H]) gradually started to appear.
Many studies were made to analyze, for example, the abundances of light elements (e.g. \citeauthor{Sandquist-2002} \citeyear{Sandquist-2002}; \citeauthor{Israelian-2003} \citeyear{Israelian-2003}), alpha and iron peak elements {(e.g.  \citeauthor{Gonzalez-2001} \citeyear{Gonzalez-2001}; \citeauthor{Takeda-2001} \citeyear{Takeda-2001}; \citeauthor{Bodaghee-2003} \citeyear{Bodaghee-2003}; \citeauthor{Ecuvillon-2004b} \citeyear{Ecuvillon-2004b}; \citeauthor{Fischer-2005} \citeyear{Fischer-2005}; \citeauthor{Beirao-2005} \citeyear{Beirao-2005}; \citeauthor{Gilli-2006} \citeyear{Gilli-2006}). 

Some interesting tendencies were found. The higher probability of finding giant planets around stars with higher metallicity was confirmed for many other elements other that iron (e.g. \citeauthor{Bodaghee-2003} \citeyear{Bodaghee-2003}; \citeauthor{Beirao-2005} \citeyear{Beirao-2005}; \citeauthor{Gilli-2006} \citeyear{Gilli-2006}). In the study on the origin of the high metallicity of planet host stars, for example, \citet{Israelian-2003} found out that HD82943 had a significant amount of $^6Li$ in its atmosphere. This is only possible if the star has engulfed lots of planetary material, because almost all original $^6Li$ is destroyed before the star enters in the main sequence and should not be detected \citep{Sandquist-2002}. Therefore, this evidence favours the accretion of planetary materials scenario (see subsection \ref{metal}). Hints of pollution were also found by \citet{Laws-2001} in 16 Cyg  in the form of a lithium enhancement.

On the other hand, \citet{Ecuvillon-2006b} showed that there is no increase of [X/H] with the condensation temperature for volatile and refractory elements, contrary to what should be expected if pollution was the main cause of the metallicity excess (i.e. volatiles of the planet should evaporate before the accretion takes place). 

Despite that, it's worth noting the strange behaviour of [X/Fe] of some elements (e.g. Mg,Mn,V,Co) on planet host stars found by some authors (\citeauthor{Bodaghee-2003} \citeyear{Bodaghee-2003}; \citeauthor{Gilli-2006} \citeyear{Gilli-2006}). This is very difficult to explain by gallactic chemical evolution models but these differences might be related to NLTE\footnote{Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium} effects \citep{Bodaghee-2003}. The enhanced abundances of Si and Ni might also increase the giant planet formation efficiency \citep{Robinson-2006}.
%But, on the top of that, it was shown once again, this time for other elements, that the frequency of giant plants is a strong function of the metallicity of its host star (e.g. \citet{Fischer-2005}, \citet{Gilli-2006} (...). It seems that the high metallicity enhances the formation of planets because, quite simply, there's more material to aggregate.

. %The last two studies required a uniform high metalicity comparison field sample, because they lacked single stars with Fe/H values higher than 0.1.  - por parte 3 %This was achieved by Gilli et al. (2006) that also provided new results using high quality spectra from a group with 101 planet host stars and 93 stars with no known planetary companions, in a uniform metallicity range between -0.7 and 0.45.  - por parte 3.

%As we can see, some studies revealed a few possible but unclear anomalies. In our study, with the high precision spectra, we will try and see if those anomalies are just bad data or if there is more than that. We will directly compare our results to this paper as we will see later on.   \textcolor{red}{[Falar no problema dos erros sistematicos na parte 2 devido as amostras de comparacao inomogeneas - source of systematic errors!!!]}

%Is is known that light elements such as $Li$ and $Be$ can be very important tracers of the history of solar type stars and therefore can be used to distinguish between different planet formation scenarios (Sandquist et al 2002). These light elements, as well as others, volatile and refractory, can also give us hints about pollution in the chemical composition of a star, if an excessive abundance of $_6Li$ or the ratio $_6Li$/$_7Li$ is detected (ver referencia!!! Sandquist?) or if an overabundance of refractory elements over volatile is observed. However the results obtained are not conclusive (Ecuvillon et al 2006) in detecting anomalies in elemental abundances or hints of pollution.

\subsection {Correlations between Metallicity and Orbital Parameters}

The possible correlations between metallicity and orbital parameters have been studied (e.g. \citeauthor{Gonzalez-1998} \citeyear{Gonzalez-1998}; \citeauthor{Santos-2003} \citeyear{Santos-2003}; \citeauthor {Fischer-2005} \citeyear {Fischer-2005}). No clear correlation has surfaced. However, stars with short period planets seem to be particularly metal rich. \citet{Ida-2004b}, in their work on the planetary formation modelling, have shown that a higher metallicity might allow a formation of giant planets faster or/and closer to their host star. Therefore, the planets should have more time to migrate, and this could explain the yet fragile correlation.  On the other hand, if the migration if fast enough, this correlation might have little meaning. %\textcolor{red}{confirmar ultima frase. ver ref.}

%\subsection {The host star mass}

%The relation of stellar mass with planetary frequency has been explored \citep{Laws-2003}. It seems to exist a slight tendency for a greater frequency of planets in stars with mass up to  1.5 $M_\odot$. Any possible conclusion is greatly limited by the fact that radial velocity studies are restricted to the mass range between 0.7 to 1.5 $M_\odot$. 

%\citet{Burkert-2007} have studied the relation between stellar mass and planetary orbital periods. They discuss that the observed shortage of massive planets in semimajor axes in the range 0.1-0.6 AU may result from a gap in the modelled radial distribution of planets. This gap may be due to shorter depletion timescales (that imply an early stop of migration) or to strong UV radiation in the early stages of planetary formation (pre main sequence).

%More studies are needed to address these and other issues concerning the host star's mass and its relation with planetary parameters.

%\subsection {Other correlations}

%Many other correlations have been explored: for instance, the relation between the presence of planets and chromospheric activity levels, ages and rotational periods of stars. No clear relations were found. However these studies are limited and possibly biased due to the fact that the stars observed are from a restricted sample ('quiet' FGK stars). Again it is necessary more research. For an overview see  \citet{Udry-2007}.

\section {Our Work}


Following the previous works on the abundances of iron and other elements we will derive the abundances of twelve species, based on the spectra of a subsample of one of the HARPS\footnote{High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planetary Searcher} 'high precision' GTO\footnote{Guaranteed Time Observations} planet search program containing 451 stars. Of these, 66 are planet hosts and the other 385 stars are dwarfs with no known orbiting planet. Nine of the studied species are refractory elements: silica, calcium, titanium, scandium, manganese, chromium, vanadium, cobalt and niquel. The other three are sodium, magnesium and aluminium.

In order to achieve this goal we will use VALD\footnote{Vienna Atomic Line Database} to obtain the initial list of the spectral lines; use IRAF\footnote{Image Reduction and Analysis Facility} to identify and select the good spectral lines; use ARES\footnote{Automatic Routine for line Equivalent widths in stellar Spectra} to automatically measure the equivalent widths (EWs) of the lines of interest; use MOOG \citep{Sneden-1973} to calculate the abundances of the species of interest and create a FORTRAN program to use the necessary programs and to organise the final abundances in an easy-to-use database.

The preparatory steps that precede the derivation of the final abundance values as well as the discussion on the uncertainties of the analysis will be explained in chapter 3. Then, the discussion of the results will follow in chapter 4: we will see if there are any differences in the distributions and trends of the stars with and without planets. Lastly, in chapter 5, we will make some concluding remarks and draft the possible future investigations. 

In the next chapter we will give a brief outlook on the determination of chemical abundances: the local thermodynamic equilibrium, the EW calculation and its dependence on the different physical parameters and the calculation of the abundance with differential analysis.

\chapter{Determination of the Chemical Abundances}

\indent This chapter is based in \citet{Gray-2005}. We will present a brief outlook on the determination of chemical abundances in a solar type star. For a more profound insight refer to chapter 13 (The Behaviour of Spectral Lines) and 16 (Chemical Analysis) of \citet{Gray-2005}. All pictures are taken from this book except when said otherwise.

\section{Introduction}

If we take a good look at a regular stellar spectra we can easily identify the presence of many absorption lines. These lines correspond to electronic transitions among the different levels of the atoms in the stellar atmosphere (bound-bound transitions). This is especially true for cooler stars of the FGKM end of the HR diagram, where the atoms and molecules of many species are not fully ionised. %In general, the results of chemical analysis show us that hidrogen is the most abundant element (~90\%) in the stellar photosphere, followed by helium (~10\%). 
The elements other than hydrogen and helium, referred as 'metals', only account for a tiny percentage of the abundance. However, most spectral lines have origin in these metal species.

These lines show different shapes and strengths that derive directly from the conditions in the photosphere of the star (temperature, pressure, radiation, magnetic and velocity fields). %We do not yet know how to totally 'deconvolute' this factors, but we will try to separate the effect of chemical composition from the other factors as much as possible. 
The most important aspect in the determination of an element's abundance is that the strength of the line absorption depends on the number of absorbers that correspond to that transition.  
%Therefore, the calculation of the atomic level populations are very important in the calculation of the abundance.

%Chemical composition can also give us insight of many phenomena (nuclear reactions, dynamics, accretion of materials in stars; light elements (Li, Be,C) as tracers of evolucionary stages of the star; the galactic chemical evolution). 

\section {Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium}
\label{LTE}
If we consider that collisions (rather that radiation) dominate the excitation of the atoms (as a good approximation in the case of solar type stars), then local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) will apply and we can express the ratio between the number of atoms in a level $n$ and the total number of the atoms of that species as
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{N_u}{N_l}=\frac{g_u}{g_l}e^{-\Delta\chi/kT},
%\label{Boltz}
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{Boltz}
 \frac{N_n}{N}=\frac{g_n}{u(T)}10^{-\theta(T)\chi_n},
\end{equation}
where $N_n$ is the population of level $n$, $N$ is the total number of atoms, $g_n$ is the degeneracy of level $n$, $\chi_n$ is the excitation energy of the same level, $\theta(T)=5040/T$, $u(T)=\Sigma g_ie^{-\chi_i/kT}$ is the partition function, $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the temperature. This is one formulation of the well known Boltzmann equation. %Note that $k$ must come in units of $eV/K$ in order to be compatible with $\chi$ in $eV$.

Similarly, the ionisation for the collision dominated gas can be calculated using Saha's Equation,
\begin{equation}
\label{Saha}
\frac{N_1}{N_0}=\frac{\Phi(T)}{P_e},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin {equation}
\Phi(T)=\frac{(\pi m_e)^{3/2}(2kT)^{5/2}}{h^3}\frac{u_1(T)}{u_0(T)}e^{-I/kT}.
\end {equation}
The $N_1/N_0$ is the ratio of ions in a given ionisation state  to the number of neutral atoms, $u_1/u_0$ is the ratio of ionic to neutral partition functions, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $h$ is the Plank's constant, $P_e$ is the electron pressure and $I$ is the ionisation potential.

%The Eqs. \ref{Boltz} and \ref{Saha} represent \textcolor{green}{the physical principles from which we will derive the abundances}. %In section (\ref{calab}), we will see how we use these principles to derive the abundances.



%\subsection {The line profile}

Thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved when the temperature, pressure and chemical potential of a system are constant. In LTE, these thermodynamic parameters are varying in space and time but this variation is slow enough for us to assume that, in some neighbourhood about each point, thermodynamic equilibrium exists (hence the 'local'). When the LTE is valid, each point will behave like a black body of temperature $T$. %This implies that the Eqs. \ref{Boltz} and \ref{Saha} will yield the same temperature. Also, this local temperature will be the same as the local kinetic (Maxwellian) temperature.    % and a line will form. 
This is, of course, an approximation, but it is acceptable for the cases when the ratio of collision to radiation induced transitions is large, as it is the case for photospheres of stars similar to the Sun. In the outer photospheric layers, LTE performs poorly due to the proximity of the open space boundary, where the radiation can escape freely. This boundary is responsible for the formation of the absorption lines.
%An absorption line will form as a result of the existence of this outer boundary. \textcolor{red}{isto esta confuso. discutir. confusao entre line profile e absorption line? ver p. 308,310}. 
We cannot use strong lines calculated by LTE because their cores form in these upper layers.

As we will see in the following sections, LTE will be used to calculate our model atmosphere and help us find the abundances of the species of interest. We must recall that the temperature in the LTE approximation is the same for all physical processes: thermal velocity distributions, ionisation equilibrium, excitation of atomic populations. It's a huge simplification over the real problem but it is very practical.

 %In the case of the weak lines, it is expected that the line profile mimics the shape of the absorption coeficient. This comes directly from model photosphere calculations in LTE. %If there are anomalies in the calculation of the abundances we will treat them as non LTE (NLTE) deviations. %The most important NLTE effect is greater ionization but this is only important in the brightest stars, which is not our case.

%In the computation of a line profile in LTE, Scattering is ignored and pure absorption is assumed as the mechanism of interaction between gas and light. 





%The details of the computations are not the objective of this work, so we will just skip them. A computation of this kind is called spectrum synthesis. %In the case of a weak line, we expect the flux  to mimic the shape of $\ell_v$.  
%We must caution, however, that all models need substancial velocity broadening coming from the rotation of the star and macroturbulence.These two factors are the major contributors of Doppler shifts in line profiles and can lead to erroneous results. 

%In order to achive this, we will need to carefully measure the equivalent widths (EW) of their lines in regions of the spectrum free of line blending other interferences (quais?). This will be explained in the following sections.




%Similarly we can express the well known Boltzmann Equation,
%\begin {equation}
%\frac{N_n}{N}=\frac{g_n}{u(T)}e^{-\chi _n/kT},
%\label{Saha}
%\end {equation}
%where $u(T)=\Sigma g_ie^{-\chi _i/kT}$ is the partition function. This equation is often expressed in powers of 10 becaming
%with $\theta=log(e)/kT$.








%If we have an equilibrium situation, for each emmited photon there must be another that is absorbed. The source funcion, that can be understood as the specific intensity emitted at some point in a hot gas (the ratio of emission to absorption), can be written as
%\begin{equation}
% S=\frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}=B(T).
%\end{equation}



\section{The Behaviour of Line Strength}
\label{linestr}
The strength or equivalent width (EW) of a spectral line depends on the absorption coefficient (the fraction of incident radiant energy absorbed per unit mass or thickness of an absorber) and on the number of absorbers, derived from Eqs. (\ref{Boltz}) and (\ref{Saha}). This implies that the line strength depends on temperature, electron pressure and the atomic constants. This is valid only as a good approximation for weak lines (i.e. lines with typical EW $\lesssim$ 200 m\AA). Stronger lines may depend on other factors. 

In the next subsections we will see how to measure the EW and, from there, how the abundance, temperature and pressure can influence the line strength of absorption lines. We will restrict our analysis to weak lines, because they are the ones that will be measured for a posterior determination of the abundance. 

\subsection{The Measurement of the EW}

Equivalent width is a measure of the intensity of a spectral line. It is defined as the width of a rectangle with height between the level of the continuum, normalised to unity, and the reference zero, having a surface equal to the profile of the spectral line, as shown on Fig. \ref{ew}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=5 cm]{pics/equivalent_width}
\caption{Illustration of a spectral line and its equivalent width. From: http://astronomy.swin.edu.au.}
\label{ew}
\end{figure}

The EW is thus measured in wavelength units (\AA{}  or m\AA). Mathematically we have

\begin{equation}
 W=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{I_c-I_\lambda}{I_c}d\lambda,
\end{equation}
where $I_c$ is the intensity of the continuum and $I_\lambda$ is the intensity of the wavelength at each $d\lambda$. Usually, the EWs are measured by fitting a gaussian function to the spectral line and to the local continuum. We must note that, in some of the following plots, the equivalent width will be represented by $W$.

From the accurate measurement of the EW of weak lines we can get the abundances of species and also calculate some stellar parameters (e.g. temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence).

\subsection{The Abundance Dependence}
\label{abdep}

The abundance is one of the most important factors in the line strength variation. As the abundance increases, line strength also increases, as expected. However, the EW does not change linearly with abundance, as we can see in Fig. \ref{cog}a. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 1cm 0cm,clip,height=4.7 cm]{pics/parte2/curve_of_growth.eps}}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 1cm 0cm,clip,height=4.7 cm]{pics/parte2/line_profile.eps}}
\caption[EW and Profile dependence of abundance] {a) Typical curve of growth from a model photosphere: $\log$-$\log$ plot of the reduced EW (W$/\lambda$) with abundance (A).; b) Line profile change with chemical abundance of the absorption species. The dots in (a) correspond to the different lines in (b).}
\label{cog}
\end{figure}

There are three different regimes. The first one corresponds to the weaker line behaviour, where the core dominates and the EW is proportional to the abundance $A$. The second phase begins when the central depth approaches the maximum value and the line saturates and grows assymptotically towards a constant value. The third one starts as the optical depth of the line wings becomes significant compared to the absorption of the continuum. We are only interested in the first phase, where the behaviour of the curve is linear.

Every spectral line shows a similar behaviour. A plot like Fig. \ref{cog}a is called a curve of growth. Fig. \ref{cog}b shows the line profile change with the chemical abundance of the absorbing species. 

\subsection{The Temperature Dependence}

Temperature is the most important variable in determining the line strength. This can be easily seen in the excitation and ionisation process equations (section \ref{LTE}).
We can appreciate the behaviour of the EW of a typical weak line with $T_{eff}$ depicted by Fig. (\ref{ewdp}). Four different cases are shown: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item weak line of a neutral species with the element mostly neutral.
 \item weak line of a neutral species with the element mostly ionised.
 \item weak line of an ion with the element mostly neutral.
 \item weak line of an ion with the element mostly ionised.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6 cm]{pics/parte2/temperature.eps}
\caption[EW dependence on Temperature and Pressure] {Plot of the behaviour of the EW of typical weak metal lines with $T_{eff}$. The cases discussed in the text are shown.}%; b) Profiles of FeII $\lambda4508$ shown for several values of surface gravity (in $cm/s^2$). Inset: change in EW.}
\label{ewdp}
\end{figure}

In cases 1 and 3 an increase in $T_{eff}$ leads to an increase in the line strength. This also happens in case 4 up to a maximum value of EW. The decrease in strength can be accounted for due to the increase in the continuum absorption from the negative hydrogen ion (case 4) or due to the ionisation of the absorbing species (case 2). In any case, we can predict how a certain line will grow or weaken by considering the ratio of the line absorption coeficient with the continuum absorption coeficient. If the former coeficient increases/decreases, the line will grow/weaken. However, if the latter increases/decreases, the line will get weaker/stronger. 

Note that the weakening of the line due to an increase of the continuum absorption also affects the lines in case 1 and 3. However, this effect is weak compared to the excitation one.

The direction and strength of change will depend on the $T_{eff}$ and on the excitation potential (the minimum energy that an electron of a certain atom needs to make a successful transition between the ground state and an excited state) of the line. For stars similar to the Sun, cases 2 and 4 apply because most elements are ionised. Solar lines of neutral species almost always decrease in strength with $T_{eff}$, but ionised species have the opposite behaviour. 

\subsection{The Pressure Dependence}

The pressure effects are visible in different ways. The dominant effect in weak lines is the change in the ratio of line absorbers to the continuum absorption (due to the H$^-$ ion in solar type stars). To account for pressure effects we must consider gas pressure ($P_g$) and electron pressure ($P_e$). In cool stars, the pressure can be approximated by $P_g\approx C g^{2/3}$ and $P_e\approx C' g^{1/3}$, where $C$ and $C'$ are constants and $g$ is the stellar surface gravity. In this case, pressure changes can be translated into approximate gravity dependences for the F, G and K stars, which is our case. We can see such dependence illustrated in Fig. \ref{cogpmt}.

It's important to emphasise that pressure effects in stellar spectra are much weaker than temperature effects. For weak metal lines in cool stars, we can enumerate the following rules, based on Eq. \ref{Saha}:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item weak lines formed where most of the element is in the next higher ionisation stage are insensitive to pressure changes.
\item weak lines formed where most of the element is in that same ionisation stage are pressure sensitive: lower pressure cause greater line strength.
\item weak lines formed where most of the element is in the next lower ionisation stage are very pressure sensitive. Lower pressure enhances the lines.
\end{enumerate}

Regarding solar type stars, where most metals are ionized, cases 1 and 2 are more common (neutral and first ion species, respectively).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
%\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=5 cm]{pics/branco}}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=5 cm]{pics/parte2/pressure.eps}}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[height=5 cm]{pics/parte2/pressure2.eps}}
\caption[Line Profiles of FeII with $\log g$] {a) Profiles of FeII $\lambda4508$ shown for several values of surface gravity (in $cm/s^2$). The inset is shown in (b) for clarity; b) $\log$-$\log$ plot of EW with surface gravity. The values of $\log g$ in (a) correspond to the dots in (b).}
\label{cogpmt}
\end{figure}

If the surface gravity ($\log g$) is unknown, it can be determined by forcing the ion and neutral solutions to give the same abundance (spectroscopic surface gravity), since the former are pressure dependent and the latter are insensitive to pressure changes.

\subsection{Microturbulence and Velocity Fields}
\label{microturbo}
%As we have seen, the slope in the curve of growth is much less in the saturation part of the curve of growth. This means that any error in the measurement of the EW in this area will translate into a much greater error in the final abundance. One more reason to use the linear portion of the curve of growth. 
%Curves of growth with different values of microturbulence
In the analysis of line profiles we should be aware that photospheric velocity fields (the turbulence) introduce Doppler shifts, that will be reflected in the spectra: the small scale motion, microturbulence, can affect the radiation transfer and the large scale motions, macroturbulence and rotation, introduce a broad distribution of Doppler shifts that reshapes the line profile, but does not change its EW. %However, the latter case will not be a problem in our study, because all the spectra that we have analysed are from slow rotating stars with low chromospheric activity.

Microturbulence is almost always incorporated into abundance analysis because it explains that the EW of saturated lines are smaller or greater than predicted. The Fig. \ref{microturb} shows the effect of microturbulence on the curve of growth. As we can see, changes in microturbulence can change the shape of the curve of growth and consequently the measured abundance. 



\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=5 cm]{pics/parte2/vtur.eps}
\caption[Curve of growth with different values of microturbulence] {Curves of growth with different values of microturbulence}
\label{microturb}
\end{figure}

%To determine $\xi$ we fit the EWs of the weakest lines and then we adopt the theoretical curve that has the best fit of the data in the saturation portion.

%Deviations from LTE can also cause similar changes in the curve of growth. This effect is much more important in strong lines \textcolor{red}{(entao pk raio e q se aplica na nossa analise????)}. The chemical abundances deduced from weak lines are not influenced by these mechanisms.
%\textcolor{red}{mas nesse caso porque usamos o microturbulencia se usamos apenas a parte linear da curva? Porque isto entra no MOOG se n e usado?}


%\section{scaling} 

%\textcolor{red}{meter ou nao eis a questao. O MOOG faz scaling? Bem, de qq forma ja esta incorporado na seccao anterior agora...ptt penso q e para tirar}

%\subsection{Temperature effects}

%If a careful analysis is performed the errors derived from temperature should not exceed 100K and might be smaller than that. 
%Temperature enters through the ionization equilibrium and shifts the curve of growth as we can see in Fig. (\ref{}).
%A simple way to test this effects is to repeat the calculation changing only the temperature and see the output of the abundance. This should not be a serious problem if the determination of the temperature is acceptable. 

\section{Calculation of the Abundance}
\label{calab}

The abundance of an element will be derived from the the EWs of the corresponding spectral lines. %In order to do this we will  use a curve of growth (log-log plot of EW as function of the number of absorbers - see Fig. \ref{cog}a) calculated with a LTE model atmosphere for each line. This is reffered to as curve of growth analysis. \textcolor{red}{confirmar isto. sera necessario mais explicacoes?}
%In this context, we have to remember that abundance cannot be obtained independently of the stellar parameters (temperature,the most important, pressure, microturbulence) or atomic constants (oscilator strength in particular,excitation potential, wavelength). A careful handling of these factors allows the construction of a curve of growth for a species using multiple lines. and enables the calculation of an abundance value independent of all parameters.
Assuming that all stellar and atomic parameters are correct and that we have a correct LTE based atmosphere calculated, we know the populations of the atoms and ions in their different levels. Then, using a radiative transfer program with differential analysis (see subsection \ref{difanal}) such as MOOG \citep{Sneden-1973} we can use the Sun and the star EWs and the atomic/stellar parameters to calculate the relative abundances of a star. This will be explained in detail in chapter \ref{chap_3}.

If the parameters are correct, we should obtain an abundance that is independent of the excitation potential and of the EW. Moreover, the abundance of the neutral atom of a species should be equal to the abundance of the ion of the same species. If they are not, there must be an error in some value of the stellar parameters, in the measured EWs or even in the model itself, in the case that NLTE effects became important. Errors can grow a lot if we have few lines to measure the EW, where line blending is severe (mostly in cooler stars) or where atomic constants (or/and stellar parameters) are not well known.



%The abundances are derived from a model atmosphere LTE calculation of a curve of growth for each line. 

%If all parameters are correct, all the abundances derived from all spectral lines of the same element will be the same. Therefore, the abundance should be independent of the stellar parameters and of the EW. 

%In this approach we are going to follow the curves of growth are implicit. The abundances are ajusted util the computed or synthesized spectrum looks like the observed one. 

%Knowing the line shapes and strengths (see section (\ref{linestr})), we can also derive some of these parameters, (spectroscopic temperature and surface gravity - refer to chapter 14 and 15 of \citet{Gray-2005}). (\textcolor{red}{ver pagina 357 ate ao fim e 371 - sera q devo desenvolver melhor isto???}).

%\textcolor{green}{VER PAGINA 386 --> meter estas formulas? perguntar ate onde ir!!!!!} \\

%If $log(gf)$ is known independently then the abundance can be calculated. (???)



%``As outlined the direct computational approach can be used, where all the scaling rules are ignored and the abundances are derived from a model atmosphere calculation of a curve of growth for each line'' (\textcolor{red}{afinal usamos as scaling rules, a direct computational approach ou ambas? - preciso de tirar esta duvida asap})


\subsection {Differential Analysis}
\label {difanal}

%By means of differential analysis or, in other words, comparing one star (normally the Sun) with another (in this case a star similar to the Sun) the oscillator strengths cancel out and the ratio of the abundances in the stars is known. This can only be applied to stars with similar stellar parameters, especially effective temperature and surface gravity. If there are errors involved in the calculations, they are the same for both stars and by the same amount.

Differential analysis consists in comparing abundances between stars. It can only be applied to stars with similar stellar parameters, especially effective temperature and surface gravity. This is our case.  The comparison is made between a reference star (usually the Sun) and a star of unknown composition, deriving the value $A/A_{ref}$ for the elements of interest, where $A_{ref}$ is the abundance of the reference star. The atomic parameters for each line are the same for both stars. Only the EW changes. The output abundance will be the logarithm of the abundance of the star to the solar abundance and will be denoted as $[X/H]=\log[A(X)_{star}/A(X)_\odot]$ and $A(X)=N_X/N_H$, where $N_X$ is the number of atoms of the $X$ element and $N_H$ is the number of atoms of hydrogen. %The hydrogen abundances cancel out because we assume that they are the same. 

One of the advantages of differential analysis is that one can derive the astrophysical oscillator strength values, instead of using laboratory measurements that may not have sufficient precision. These values are obtained via an inverse analysis: we start with the known abundances and the EW of a certain species line for the Sun and we determine its oscillator strength (expressed as $\log gf$, where $g$ is the degeneracy and $f$ is the strength of the electronic transition). The same oscillator strength value will be used in both stars, thus minimizing the internal errors. This is detailed in subchapter \ref{newloggf}. However, this has an intrinsic disadvantage: strictly speaking, the calculated $\log gf$ are only 100\% reliable for the Sun and the analysis gets worse as we get further away from the Sun's parameters. 

We need to note that deviations from LTE typically cause errors of no more than a few percent, in Solar type stars. We also need to note that this abundance is only valid in the atmosphere of the star. %The abundance of its interior might be totally different.

The solar composition is a standard for many differential stellar analysis and for the basic chemical mix entering many stellar photosphere models. The mass fraction used is typically X=0.735 for hydrogen, Y=0.248 for helium and Z=0.017 for all other elements. One can obtain the reference abundance values of the Sun from, for example, \citet{Anders-1989}.

%\section {The synthesis method}

%The computation of a complete spectral interval where all the observed lines are included is called a synthesis. This method is especially useful when line blending is severe (cool stars) or stars showing large rotational broadening. It works best when all spectral lines can be identified and all its parameters are known and consists in the arbitrary adjustment of abundances, oscilator strenghts and line and doppler broadening until the spectrum is reproduced. (Sneden 1973).

\chapter {Data and Spectral Analysis}
\label{chap_3}
The details of the technique used for the determination of the abundances will be explained in the following chapter.  It's important to emphasise that this is an homogeneous study. It means that the spectra used to measure the EW of the atomic lines were taken with the same instrument (HARPS), reduced/normalised with the same methodology and that the calculated atomic and stellar parameters were based on the same atmospheric models and line lists.

\section {The HARPS Spectrograph}

%Originally designed to detect low mass exoplanets by RV up to the  1m/s threshhold, HARPS can also be used to acquire high resolution high S/N spectra of planet host stars. This spectra can then be used for abundance studies, which is our case. 

HARPS is a fibre-fed, cross dispersed echelle spectrograph. It operates at a constant temperature of 17$^\circ$C, and at a constant pressure < 10$^{-2}$ mbar. It is located in the Coud\'{e} floor of the ESO\footnote{European Southern Observatory} La Silla 3.6 m telescope. Two fibres, an object and a reference fibre, fed the spectrograph with light from the telescope and from the calibration lamps (or sky). The light is reimaged by the internal optics onto a mosaic of two 2k4 CCDs\footnote{Charge-Coupled Devices} where two spectra of 72 orders are formed. The spectral range goes from 380 to 690 nm. At a resolution ($R\equiv\lambda/\Delta\lambda$) of 115.000, each spectral element is sampled by 3.2 CCD pixels. For further details refer to \citet{Mayor-2003b}. 

%The most obvious error source is photon noise: it is the one coming from the finite number of photons collected in a stellar spectrum. The fundamental uncertainty on the RV depends both on the number of recorded photons and on the intrinsic slope of the spectrum. 
%Stellar Oscillation Noise. Solar type stars show p mode oscillations with periods of a few minutes and amplitudes of a few m/s. However some of these signals can superimpose. The present strategy regarding this noise is to integrate over a few characteristic periods to average out these effects as much as possible. This maintains this noise below 1 m/s.
%Stellar activity related jitter. Magnetic phenomena at the surface of solar type stars can induce RV perturbations in the order of 100 m/s. This prevents completely the use of RV technique to detect planetary companions. Stars in the HARPS catalogue are chosen for showing low chromospheric activity and slow rotation. to ensure that these effects stay below a few m/s. 

\section {Spectral Data}

The spectra for the HARPS 'high precision' GTO program was obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at the ESO La Silla 3.6 m telescope. This sample is composed of 451 stars selected from the volume limited sample of solar neighbourhood stars studied with the CORALIE spectrograph \citep{Udry-2000} as well as a group of planet host stars from the southern hemisphere. The total number of planet-bearing stars is 66. Every star in the catalogue is slowly rotating, non evolved and with a low chromospheric activity. For a more detailed description see \citet{Sousa-2008}.

The main goal of the GTO program is the detection of very low mass exoplanets aiming to push the RV accuracy below  $1m/s$ \citep{Mayor-2003b}. We will use the high resolution high S/N\footnote{Signal to Noise ratio} spectral samples of this program to calculate the abundances. 

The individual spectra were reduced using the HARPS pipeline and later combined using IRAF after correcting for its radial velocity. The final spectra have a resolution of $R\sim115.000$ and a signal to noise ratio ranging from $\sim70$ to $\sim2000$ depending on the amount and quality of the original spectra. Nine tenths of the spectra have S/N higher than 200.

%In order to average out stellar oscillations, the observations lasted at least 15 minutes. Sometimes it's necessary to separate the observations in several exposures in order to avoid the saturation of the detector. The result is a very high quality spectrum of each star. 

A solar spectrum was also collected with HARPS using solar light reflected by the asteroid Ceres. This spectrum has the same resolution of the star's spectra and a S/N ratio of $\sim250$. 

A sample of the 'high precision' GTO catalogue is shown in Table \ref{cat_sample}. The stellar parameters of this table were determined by \citet{Sousa-2008}. The full catalogue is available at $http://www.astro.up.pt/\sim sousasag/harps\_gto\_catalogue.html$.

\section {Identification and Selection of the Spectral Lines}

The first part of this work consisted in the identification and selection of the weak spectral lines of the following species: alpha group elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Sc), iron peak elements (Mn, V, Cr, Co, Ni) and also Na, Mg and Al. The absorption lines of some of the first ionised species (TiII, ScII, CrII)  were also selected. The species with absorption lines from both the neutral atom and the ion will be denoted as XI (for the neutral atom) and XII (for the ion) throughout this work, where X=Ti, Sc or Cr. 

Fig. \ref{esquema} illustrates the most important steps in the process of identification and selection of the spectral lines. These steps will be described in detail in the following subsections. % a) shows the , from the acquisition of the lines at VALD to the final list of lines; b) shows the necessary steps needed to calculate the astrophysical oscillator strengths.

\subsection {Using VALD to Obtain the Initial List of Spectral Lines}
\label{VALD}
Our study started with a request at the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD - \citeauthor{Kupka-1999} \citeyear{Kupka-1999})  of every spectral line (including the lines of the species that will be investigated) and its atomic parameters (wavelength, oscillator strength, excitation potential) %created with a synthetic spectra (Kurucz 1993 - \textcolor{red}{confirmar!}) 
from $4500$ to $6910$ \AA. The request was done via the internet\footnote{$http://www.astro.uu.se/\sim vald/$}. %These lines are obtained from a synthetic spectra based on Kurucz Atlas 9 plane-parallel model atmospheres (Kurucz 1993).

Inside VALD, the 'extract stellar' option was chosen and the following parameters were inserted: Spectral Region: $4500-6910$ \AA ; $T_{eff}=5777$ K; $\log g=4.44$ dex\footnote{decimal exponent}; $\xi_t=1.0$ km/s; detection limit = 0.05, where $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature, $\log g$ is the surface gravity and $\xi_t$ is the microturbulence of the star. The stellar and atomic parameters inserted in the model are those of the Sun. The 'detection limit' option was set to 0.05, meaning that only the spectral lines with central depths greater than 5\% of the continuum were accepted. The goal here was to use the most approximate model of the Sun as possible in order to obtain the relevant spectral lines in a solar type star. 

The acquired output contained the wavelength, excitation potential, estimated line depth and oscillator strength for each spectral line. The 'extract stellar' option has the advantage of supplying all the spectral lines. This will help to identify lines that overlap with the lines of interest in the subsequent analysis of the spectra.

%Sometimes, two lines overlap and this is not visible in the spectrum. When this happens, we have to reject the line. This helps a lot in a first identification and selection of the 'good' lines. 

\subsection {Using IRAF to Identify the 'Good' Lines}
\label{idiraf}
With IRAF\footnote{$http://iraf.noao.edu/$} splot tool, we opened a noiseless synthetic spectrum of the Sun (Kurucz Solar Flux Atlas - \citet{Kurucz-1984} ) with an extremely high resolution and we carefully checked for the existence of the lines of interest.

We only chose isolated or lightly blended lines. Then, we measured their EW. All lines with EWs lower than 5 m\AA\, or inside the wings of strong lines (e.g. $H_\alpha$ ($\lambda=6562.81$ \AA), $H_\beta$ ($\lambda=4861.34$ \AA) and strong $\lambda5172.70,\lambda5183.62$ Mg I lines) were excluded. %We have also excluded all lines that overlap with our lines of interest in the VALD list, even if these 'rogue' lines are very small: both lines can be much stronger or/and much weaker in a star with different parameters. 
A classification system was made, ranging from 1 (blended, distorted or hard to read lines) to 5 (totally isolated lines). 364 lines were selected in this first phase, from an initial list of 2169 lines. 

It's worth noting two things regarding the manual measurement of the EW of the spectral lines using IRAF: 1) we should always choose a region of at least 1 \AA{} to each side from the centre of the line of interest and deconvolute all lines in that region; 2) when measuring a line we should never target the pointer to any place above the continuum: this can lead to an overestimation of the EW.% It is wise to target slightly below the highest points of the continuum.

\subsection {Measuring the EWs of the Solar Lines with ARES}
\label{ARES}
We used ARES (Automatic Routine for Line Equivalent Widths - \citeauthor{Sousa-2007} \citeyear{Sousa-2007}) to automatically measure the equivalent widths of our lines. First, we analysed the lines of two different spectra: one is a resolution degraded spectrum made from the Kurucz Solar Flux Atlas ($R=110.000$) and the other is a spectrum of the Sun's reflected light from the Ceres asteroid taken with the HARPS spectrograph\footnote{Collection of HARPS solar spectra: $http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/sciops/3p6/harps/monitoring/sun.html$}, with R$\sim$115.000 and S/N$\sim250$. %\textcolor{red}{confirmar valores de R e S/N}.



The measurement of the EWs was done one line at a time and was monitored with a graphical interface (plots\_flag=1 within the 'mine.opt' file). This way we could see if the lines were being fitted properly.

The EW measurement in these very similar spectra allowed us to establish a tighter criteria: 1) if we obtained $|(EW_{Kurucz}-EW_{Ceres})/EW_{Kurucz}|>0.10$ for the same line we discarded this line; 2) then, every line with $|EW_{Kurucz}-EW_{Ceres}|>1$ m\AA{} was investigated to see if it was subjected to blending effects and discarded if appropriate. These criteria are important because the abundance is very sensitive to variations in the EW. %Therefore, if we are going to use a model atmosphere for each star to predict the abundances, we will need a line list with the real EWs as close as possible to the ones measured with the synthetic spectrum based on the same atmosphere model. (\textcolor{red}{se nao e por isto entao porque e??? discutir!}

In order to optimise the calculation of the EWs, we chose the following ARES parameters (within the 'mine.opt' file): smoother = 4, space = 2, lineresol = 0.07, miniline = 5 and rejt = 0.996, where 'smoother' is a parameter to adjust the noise smoothing (1 to 4, the bigger the number, the greater the smoothing produced in the first derivative of the spectrum), 'space' is the interval, in Angstrom, used for the computation of each line; 'lineresol' sets the line resolution (in \AA) of the input spectra (if the program finds two lines closer than this value he will treat them as one line),  'miniline' is the minimum value of line strength (in m\AA{}) accepted to write a line in the output file and 'rejt' is a parameter for the calibration of the normalised continuum (0 to 1). The 'rejt' is the most important parameter for the correct automatic determination of the continuum (\citeauthor{Sousa-2007} \citeyear{Sousa-2007}, \citeauthor{Sousa-2008} \citeyear{Sousa-2008}). The higher the S/N ratio the higher should be the rejt parameter value.

We also repeated the classification process for both spectra. All lines with classification 1 were rejected and lines with classification 2 were investigated and discarded when appropriate. Additionally, all lines situated in regions of strong variation of the continuum as well as lines with bad fits were excluded. At the end of the process, we had a new list with 284 lines. 

\subsection {Calculating New Oscillator Strengths}
\label{newloggf}
The EWs of the new list of lines and a Kurucz grid model for the Sun \citep{Kurucz-1993} (having $T_{eff}=5777$, $\log g=4.44$, $\log\epsilon_{Fe}=7.47$ and $\xi_t=1.0$, where $\log\epsilon_{Fe}$ is the solar abundance of iron relative to hydrogen as used by \citeauthor{Santos-2004b} \citeyear{Santos-2004b}) were used to calculate new semi-empirical atomic oscillator strengths for the spectral lines from an inverted solar analysis. This is necessary because the $\log gf$ values obtained from VALD may not be accurate enough. The new oscillator strengths will be used to make a better differential analysis. This implies, of course, that the derived abundance values will always be relative to the Sun.

The calculations of the $\log gf$ were carried out with the 'ewfind' driver of the 2002 version of the LTE stellar line analysis program MOOG \citep{Sneden-1973}. The fixed solar abundances used in MOOG were taken from Anders and Grevesse (1989). The excitation potential and the initial value of $\log gf$ of every line came from the VALD database, as referred in subsection \ref{VALD}. All input parameters for 'ewfind' were taken following \citet{Santos-2004b}. 
%\textcolor{red}{Sera relevante meter aqui os parametros do ewfind.par? Parece-me demasiado tecnico. e necessario dizer porque e q se calcula novos valores}


%The parameters used with ewfind that are relevant to emphasize are the following: molecules=1 (it calculated the molecular equilibrium), flux/int=0(perform integrated flux calculations) and damping=2 (use the Un . All other parameters were taken by default. For further information refer to MOOG Manual (...).

The calculation of the new $\log gf$ values was done with an iterative FORTRAN program. For each individual line, we input at MOOG the fixed excitation potential, the fixed solar EWs and a variable value of the oscillator strength (starting with the $\log gf$ provided by VALD). At the end of each iteration, we got a certain value of the abundance as output. The true value of $\log gf$ is obtained when the value of the abundance for each element equals its solar abundance. %The iteration ends when the correlation coefficients between the abundance and $\chi_l$ and between the abundance and the reduced equivalent width (RW) are zero. 
In order to achieve the convergence of abundances, we used a simple bisection method in the iteration. It takes no more than a few minutes to obtain the correct $\log gf$ for all lines. 

If we invert this analysis, we can use the new oscillator strengths to obtain the abundance of any element for every star. %\textcolor{red}{preciso perceber isto melhor. discutir com o Nuno...mas este e mesmo o verdadeiro valor de log $gf$ ou e so um artificio para fixar os parametros e calcular a abundancia por analise diferencial???}.

\subsection {A Test using the Solar Abundance Values}

In order to confirm that the calculated $\log gf$ values were correct, we made a test using the measured EWs of the Sun's Ceres spectrum and a \citet{Kurucz-1993} atmospheres model (with the solar parameters) to calculate the abundances using MOOG 'abfind' driver. This time, we did the inverse analysis: the $\log gf$ and the EW values were fixed and the abundance was made to converge to a value corresponding to the fixed $\log gf$ and EW values. The average values of the abundances are within 0.01 dex of the expected value except for Al ($\Delta A$= 0.03 with 2 lines), ScI ($\Delta A$=0.03 with 3 lines) and V ($\Delta A$=0.02 with 14 lines), where $A$ is the abundance of a species. However, the derived abundance of these three species are well within the abundance errors determined by \citet{Anders-1989}. Despite that, we shall check them for biases. No further lines were removed from the line list at this point. %\textcolor{red}{por aqui uma tabela com estes dados?}

\subsection {The Molecular Equilibrium}

Some of the analysed species may form molecules. This tendency increases for lower temperatures and can change the abundance of the element in question, if not properly corrected. Obviously, this effect is stronger in cooler stars.

In order to find if the use of molecular equilibrium was needed to correct the abundance of certain species, we measured the EWs using ARES and calculated the abundances for the coolest star in our sample, HD218511, using the MOOG code ('abfind' driver) and a Kurucz model atmosphere with the star's parameters ($T_{eff}=4556$, $\log g=4.31$, $\xi_t=0.41$, $[Fe/H]=-0.10$).  This calculation was done with two different values of the 'abfind' driver parameter 'molecules'. If 'molecules' was set to zero, MOOG would not use molecular equilibrium. If molecules was set to one, MOOG would calculate the abundance with the molecular equilibrium correction. No change in the abundance of any element was found. Therefore, we chose not to use molecular equilibrium when calculating the abundances.

\subsection {Testing a small sub-sample Containing 20 Stars} 
\label{20stars}
In order to finish the selection of the spectral lines, two different groups of stars were chosen. The first group contained 10 stars with $T_{eff}$ closer to 5000 K, hereafter 'cool group'. The second group contained 10 stars with $T_{eff}$ closer to the Solar temperature (5777 K), hereafter 'hot group'. We will calculate the abundance of both groups separately and then we will observe the dispersion and difference to the mean value of abundance of each line, for every element and star, and make the selection of the lines based on appropriate criteria. %\textcolor{red}{meter aqui uma tabela deste sub sample?}

This analysis is very important. With it, we can find lines that yield systematically wrong abundance values due to an incorrect measurement of the EW (originated in blending effects - stronger in cooler stars - or in a poor position in the continuum), due to errors of the analysis methodology (the differential analysis used is based on the Sun and the further away a star is from the Sun's parameters the greater the errors the analysis will yield: this is especially true for temperature differences), or simply due to systematic errors of unknown origin.

First, we measured the EWs with ARES. The input parameters were the same as the ones used in subsection \ref{ARES} except 'rejt' that changed with the S/N ratio of each star, according to \citet{Sousa-2008}. 

Then, we made a small FORTRAN program that used the 'abfind' driver within MOOG and a grid of Kurucz (1993) ATLAS9 atmospheres to calculate the abundance of the individual elements. We can see in Fig. \ref{Ni20} the difference between the abundance of each line and the mean abundance of the respective star, for Ni, shown as example. The red and the blue dots correspond to the 'hot' and 'cool' groups respectively. The mean value of this difference will be referred as $\Delta A$. The cyan and black crosses are the $\Delta A$ of the hot and the cool group, respectively, and the error bars represent the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of these mean values.

The cyan and black crosses are the mean value of the difference between the abundance of each line and the mean abundance of the respective star. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean values.}
\label{Ni20}
\end{figure}

Following the analysis of Fig. {\ref{Ni20}, the lines were selected according to two different criteria: 1) all lines within the hot group with $\Delta A$ or/and with a dispersion greater than 0.05 dex were excluded; 2) all lines of the cool group with $\Delta A$ or/and  with a dispersion greater than 0.1 dex were excluded. It was taken great care in identifying stray points clearly out of the $2\sigma$ distribution (due to bad pixels, cosmic rays or other unknown effects) that could alter the true value of the mean or the dispersion of a certain line. This is the case, for example, of the 5468.11 \AA{} line in the hot group or the 5694.99 \AA{} line in the cold group that could have been excluded if the criteria was strictly obeyed. 

After the selection of the spectral lines according to this criteria, we created a final list with 159 lines, as shown in Table \ref{loggf}.

\section {Spectral Analysis of the Full Sample}

We proceeded as in subsection \ref{20stars}, but this time for the full sample of 451 stars. As we have seen before, the chemical abundances of the elements in study were derived via a standard Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) using a  differential analysis relative to the Sun. 

First, we used ARES to automatically measure the lines listed in Table \ref{loggf} for every star of the catalogue. The ARES parameters that we used were the same as in subsection \ref{ARES} (smoother = 4; space = 2 and lineresol = 0.07) except 'rejt' that changed with the S/N ratio of each star, according to \citet{Sousa-2008}, and 'miniline' that was set to 2 (to make sure that the weakest lines measured in the spectrum of the Sun were not excluded in the other stars due to some weakening effect in the strength of the lines - an effect typically observed in the hottest stars of this sample).

Then, using the EWs and a grid of ATLAS9 atmospheres (Kurucz 1993) with the corresponding star parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence and metallicity - see Table \ref{cat_sample}) we computed the abundances of the elements with the 'abfind' driver of the 2002 version of MOOG \citep{Sneden-1973}. A FORTRAN program was made to coordinate the calculations and set up an organised database of the output data. To account for random events that might 'fall' out of the normal distribution range (cosmic rays, bad pixels, unknown effects), we removed in every star and for every element all the lines with $\Delta A>2\sigma$ relative to the mean abundance value. Then, a new final mean abundance value was derived. A sample of the final abundance results can be seen in Table \ref{abundance_table}. 

\subsection {Uncertainties}
\label{uncertain}
Uncertainties can introduce different errors in the calculated abundances. Random errors can affect individual lines in the calculation of EWs and systematic errors can surface due to blending and NLTE effects or to a poor location of the lines in the continuum. To avoid both types of errors, we should have high quality data and as many lines as possible for each element. Unfortunately we were only able to select 2/3 lines for Mg, Na, Al, CrII and ScI. The lack of statistical data can introduce systematic bias extremely difficult to locate in our results. Therefore, all conclusions regarding these elements should be taken with caution. We have also performed an uniform analysis of the sample. This minimises possible errors due to differences in line lists, atmospheric parameters, oscillator strength biases, applied methodologies, etc. 
%\textcolor{green}{falar da distribuicao de Fe/H na amostra e mostrar o gfx?? Explicar o porque de ignorar o NLTE? }
%The abundance trends can also be affected by an uneven distribution of the metallicity of the stars toward higher metallicities. The distribution of [Fe/H] can be observed in Fig. \ref{}. 

In the end, the final abundance results had a typical dispersion that ranged from about $rms=0.02$ dex for aluminium to $rms=0.1$ dex for vanadium. It's important to note that, in this study, we are not taking into account the uncertainties associated with the stellar parameters or with the atmospheric models.

%The typical standard error for the whole sample is of the order of 0.03 dex...ver papers e discutir!!!} 

\subsection {Testing the Stellar Parameters and Searching \\for Systematic Effects}
\label{testpar}
In order to verify the used stellar parameters,  we tested our results in a variety of ways. First, we calculated the slopes of the abundances as a function of the excitation potential (EP) and as a function of the logarithm of the reduced equivalent width (RW) for Ni. The EP is the minimum amount of energy required to bring an electron from its ground state to a given excited state, and the RW is just the EW divided by the wavelength. The slopes are calculated from the abundances given by MOOG for every spectral line and star. In this way we can verify if the excitation equilibrium that was forced for the Fe I lines on every star and used to obtain the stellar parameters \citep{Santos-2000b} is acceptable for other species. We can see an example (star HD1461) in Fig \ref{exslope}. We have chosen niquel because it has a good range of both EP and RW, thus allowing a good determination of the slopes.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0mm 0mm 0mm 10mm, clip,width= 10 cm]{pics/parte3/moogpicniq.eps}
\caption[Example of the calculation for Ni of the slope EP and RW]{Example of the calculation of the slope EP and RW for Ni in the star HD1461. The black squares represent the different spectral lines, the long dashed line the calculated slope and the short dashed line the average value of the abundance ($\log$ eps). The slope EW = -0.010 and slope RW = 0.020.}
\label{exslope}
\end{figure}

 %As we have seen in section \ref{calab}, 
%We expect that the slopes will be around zero, because if LTE holds and the input parameters are correct, the elemental abundance will be independent of the EP and RW. 
Then, we plotted the slopes of the EP and RW, obtained for every star, as function of the stellar parameters ($T_{eff}$, $\log g$ , $\xi_t$ and [Fe/H]), as shown in Figs. \ref{slopeEP} and \ref{slopeRW}. We expect that the slopes won't change with any of the stellar parameters.

\label{slopeRW}
\end{figure}

From the analysis of the plots, we can see no discernible trends except in the case of the $T_{eff}$ plots, where we observe that cooler stars  have more dispersion on average. This might be due to the fact that it is much more difficult to measure the EW (due to blending) in cooler stars. We also observe a slight positive slope in the $T_{eff}$ plot of Fig. \ref{slopeRW}, but it is too small to be relevant. We consider that the observed trends are not very strong, and in general, we consider that for Ni the excitation equilibrium is valid. There is one exception, however: The star HD209458 has a slope RW greater than 0.4 dex. This can be clearly seen in every plot of Fig. \ref{slopeRW}. The abundance of Ni for this star will be considered invalid and raises serious concerns about the validity of the abundance results for the other elements. Despite that, we will let it appear in the results in order to see how such an error can propagate into the final abundance results.





%We also noted that, in Fig. (\ref{slopeteff}), the Ni dispersion is lower than Cr dispersion for the same plot. The reduced dispersion might be related to the bigger number of Ni lines used to calculate the abundances and/or to the supposed superior quality of the Ni lines. We have also noticed that all the plots of Cr except the one in Fig. (\ref{slopeteff}) show Slope EP having a trend toward positive values and Slope RW having a trend toward negative values. \textcolor{red}{mas porque??? e uma dispersao natural? esta ultima frase esta confusa}

%(We also expect that if we plot these slopes in function of the stellar parameters we should also obtain a fit of the data with all slopes approaching the ordinate axis. \textcolor{red}{sera??? mas isto n e para o X/FE? estes slopes sao do X/H!!! precisava de comparar estes gfx com outros - n tenho sensibilidade para ver se aceitavel ou nao. depende da escala! sera q vale a pena fazer fits para estes gfx? - isto temos mesmo q ver pessoalmente})

We have also plotted the [CrI/CrII] value with $T_{eff}$ and $\log g$ to ensure that the ionisation equilibrium that was forced to the FeII lines \citep{Santos-2000b} was acceptable to chromium (i.e. the abundance of CrII was forced to be equal to the abundance of CrI). This is depicted in Fig. \ref{cr2cr1}. We expect that [CrI/CrII] will be independent of $T_{eff}$ and $\log g$, with value around zero. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[angle=-90, trim=5mm 0mm 100mm 10mm, clip, width=12cm]{pics/parte3/CrICrII.eps}
\caption[Plots of CrI/CrII]{Plots of [CrI/CrII] with $T_{eff}$ and $\log g$. The red dashed lines indicate the solar value.}.
\label{cr2cr1}
\end{figure}

However, there is a divergence of the expected ratio for stars with $T_{eff}$<4900 K. This result raises many doubts on the abundance values derived for stars with lower temperatures.

Finally, we plotted the abundance of every element as a function of $T_{eff}$ and $\log g$, represented by Figs. \ref{xfeteff} and  \ref{xfelogg}, respectively. We used the [X/Fe] ratio to take into account the trend of the galactic chemical evolution. The slopes of [X/Fe] with $T_{eff}$ per 1000 K and with the surface gravity are listed in Table \ref{slopes}.

\end{table}

We observe significative trends with $T_{eff}$ for TiI, ScI, V, CrII, Co and Al. We can clearly see that the trend away from the expected value, except for Co and Al, is heavily influenced by the cooler stars, where the abundance might have been overestimated due to blending effects, to deviations from the excitation or ionisation equilibrium or to problems associated with the differential analysis: we must not forget that the oscillator strengths were calculated for the Sun.

\label{xfelogg}
\end{figure}
In order to account for these effects we have decided to establish a cutoff temperature: $T_{cutoff}=5000$ K for TiI and CrII, $T_{cutoff}=5100$ K for ScI and $T_{cutoff}=5300$ K for V. We shall note this when we analyse the results. We do not know how to explain the observed trends in Co and Al. They might be related to NLTE effects that were not taken into account in this analysis.

In the case of the $\log g$ plots, a clear trend is much more difficult to discern: most stars are in the (4.2 - 4.6) region. Moreover, we verify the existence of a huge dispersion in the same region for ScI, V and CrII. Despite that, we can see decreasing trends in ScII, Mn and Co, but we think that they are not relevant. 

%In order to avoid systematic errors in the measurement of EW due to blending lines or to a poor location in the continuum, we have analyzed the biggest number of lines possible for each element. .

\chapter{Results: the Abundance of Stars with Planets}

%As we have seen in the previous chapter, we have a catalogue with 451 stars, from which 66 stars host planetary companions. We hope that this smaller sample will be enough to verify if there are any peculiarities that might differentiate planet host and non-planet host stars. 

The major goal of this study is the determination and comparison of the abundances between two groups of stars: stars with planets and stars without planets. As we have seen in the previous chapter, we have a catalogue with 451 stars, from which 66 stars host planetary companions. We hope that this smaller sample will be enough to verify if there are any peculiarities that might differentiate planet host and non-planet host stars. In this chapter, we will see what we have found. We will present the results obtained for the abundances of the stars and compare them with similar studies from the literature.

A sample of the results are presented in Table \ref{abundance_table}. The complete results are available online (in .rdb format) at http://www.astro.up.pt/$\sim$nuno/vasco\_table4.1.tar.gz.

%\citet{Gilli-2006}, hereafter GIL, have recently made an abundance determination with the same species of our work. It will be very interesting to compare her work to ours. It will also be interesting to confront our results to those of  \citet{Bodaghee-2003} (hereafter BOD). They have studied the same refractory elements as we did. Some of the elements that were analysed here had their abundances determined by \citet{Gonzalez-2001}, \citet{Takeda-2001},  \citet{Sadakane-2002}, \citet{Beirao-2005} and \citet{Fischer-2005}, hereafter GON, TAK, SAD, BEI and FIS, respectively. 

%We have also compared our work with \citet{Bensby-2003} and \citet{Reddy-2003}, hereafter BEN and RED respectively, in order to test the consistency of our results against two general studies of chemical abundances in F/G/K main sequence stars of the solar neighbourhood.

%All these works will be compared to ours, when appropriate.

\section{Comparison of [X/H] Values with the Literature}

In order to test the reliability of our results, we made a comparison of the derived abundances with the ones obtained by \citet{Bodaghee-2003}, \citet{Beirao-2005} and \citet{Gilli-2006} (hereafter BOD, BEI and GIL respectively), as seen in Fig. \ref{gfxcomparison}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 1.5cm 0cm 1cm,clip,width=16 cm]{pics/parte4/comp.eps}
\caption[Comparison of abundances with other authors]{Comparison of the derived abundances with other authors: \citet{Gilli-2006} (blue circles), \citet{Bodaghee-2003} (red triangles, except for Na, Mg and Al) and \citet{Beirao-2005} (red triangles for Na, Mg and Al). The elements are identified at the top left corner of each plot.}
\label{gfxcomparison}
\end{figure}

All common stars were used except for TiI, ScI, CrII and V, where we only used stars above a cutoff effective temperature, as it was determined in subsection \ref{testpar}. We must note that, for Na, Mg and Al, most of GIL results are equal to BEI, simply because GIL used BEI results. 





We can see that, in general terms, our results agree with the [X/H] obtained by the other authors. However, we observe a slight systematic overabundance trend in Ca, CrI and CrII (GIL) and a slight systematic underabundance in Mg and Al (GIL and BEI). It's worth mentioning the extra underabundance of a few stars in V and Ca. We do not know the origin of these differences. We consider that the observed differences are relatively small and do not compromise the results or the main goal of this work, since we will be doing a differential analysis comparing stars with and without planets.



%The abundances of TiII, Sc and CrII were tested against the values of TiI, ScII and CrI (respectively) of GIL and BOD in order to see if the [X/H] values obtained for both the neutral atom and the ion were consistent with their results. The Sc and CrII tests are acceptable but the TiII is not. \textcolor {red}{porque? ver porque disto. discutir fara sentido fazer isto?}




\section{The [X/H] Distributions} 

The distributions of [X/H] of planet hosts and non-planet hosts are depicted in Fig. \ref{gfxdistro}. The stars with  and without planets are represented by a solid red line and by a dotted blue line, respectively. The blue and red vertical lines above each histogram represent the mean value of metallicity of the non-host planet and the host planet distributions, respectively. Each plot has the name of the respective element in the upper right corner and the cutoff temperature, if appropriate.

We can clearly observe that there is a metallicity excess for planet host stars for all the elements studied. These results are in good agreement with previous similar studies (BOD, BEI and GIL). Our results also agree with previous studies of iron abundances (see section \ref{metal}), as expected.

          Al & 0.10 & 0.17 & -0.06 & 0.21 & 0.16\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{avgabund} lists the average values of [X/H] along with their rms and the difference of averages between stars with and without planets. These differences go from 0.16 for Mg and Al to 0.25 for Mn. %However, these numbers are not significative, due to the high dispersion around the mean. Despite that, 
The difference of the average abundance between the two groups of stars is, on average, slightly below the figures of BOD and GIL by $\sim$0.03 dex. The dispersion of this difference is also smaller, likely atesting the quality of our values.

\label{gfxdistro}
\end{figure}





It is interesting to see that in most histograms (except for Mg) the distributions of the abundances in planet host stars are not symmetrical: there is an increase of [X/H] up to a maximum and shortly after there is a huge cutoff in distribution. This cutoff is located at [X/H]$\sim0.4$ for TiII, Ca, CrI and Na, [X/H]$\sim0.5$ for Si, TiI, ScII, Mn, CrII, V, Co, Ni and Al and [X/H]$\sim0.7$ for ScI. The cutoff might suggest that we are looking at the metallicity limit of the solar neighbourhood stars \citep[e.g.][]{Santos-2003}, as most of the planet hosts are at the high metallicity end of the sample. 

Some histograms seem to be slightly bimodal (Mn, V, Na). We do not know why this happens. It might be due only to small number statistics. 




%\section{The [X/H] versus [Fe/H] plots}
%\label{xhfeh}
%The Fig. (\ref{xhfeh1}) depicts the [X/H] versus [Fe/H] plots for all species. A linear function of [X/H] with [Fe/H] is observed, where the slope of the plots vary with the different elements. They are in general agreement with the results of GIL, BEI and SAD. The [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation is much more used to analyse the abundances. We will see why in section (\ref{xfefeh}). 

%\begin{figure}[h!]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=16 cm, height=15 cm]{pics/parte4/xhfehfinal/xhfehtfinal.eps}
%\caption[abundance gfx]{[X/H] vs. [Fe/H] plots of the elements in study. The red triangles and the blue circles represent the stars with and without planets respectively. The intersection of the dashed red lines indicate the solar value.}
%\label{xhfeh1}
%\end{figure}

%The trends observed in the plots can be attributed to the galactic chemical evolution. There are no observed differences in the trends of the stars with planets and without planets. The planet host stars just appear to be only the high metallicity extension of the greater non-planet star sample. 

%One can get a different and perhaps clearer image of these trends by analysing the plots of Fig. (\ref{xhfeh2}). These are the same as those of Fig.(\ref{xhfeh1}) but only for stars with $T_{eff}=T_{Sun}\pm$ 200 K. This time the dispersion is much lower and we can see what seems be a different population with higher [X/H] for [Fe/H] $\lesssim$ -0.1,0.2 in the plots of some species (Si, Ti, TiII, ScII, Mg, Al). %These stars might have migrated to our stellar neighborhood and have possibly formed in the thick disc of the galaxy (Fuhrmann-2004). 
%We will not pursue this relation further: it will be studied in a future work.

\section {The [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] Plots}
\label{xfefeh}
The [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plots are traditionally used to study the chemical evolution of the galaxy as well as to identify the stars of the different populations of the galaxy (thin disk, thick disk, halo), which have distinct abundance ratios (see e.g. \citeauthor{Bensby-2003} \citeyear{Bensby-2003}, \citeauthor{Fuhrmann-2004} \citeyear{Fuhrmann-2004}). In our study, we will analyse them only to observe if there are any differences in the abundance of stars with and without planets for a similar value of [Fe/H]. A chemical evolution study will be postponed to the near future: we refer the prospective reader to \citet{McWilliam-1997}. The [Fe/H] can be used as a time variable, but this is still controversial. 

The abundance value of the X element relative to the Fe abundance of each star is calculated by subtracting the derived abundance of the X element of a star with the [Fe/H] values (provided by \citeauthor{Sousa-2008} \citeyear{Sousa-2008}) of the same star. Therefore, [X/Fe] $=$ [X/H] $-$ [Fe/H].

%The greatest advantage of the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plots is that...\textcolor{red}{clarificar isto com Nuno} it allows an independent analysis of the iron abundance and thus eliminates the slopes present in Figs. \ref{xhfeh1} and \ref{xhfeh2}. In this way, we can have a better perspective of the abundance trends with [Fe/H]. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[trim=0cm 2cm 0cm 1cm,clip,width=16 cm]{pics/parte4/xfefehfinal/xfefehtfinal.eps}
\caption[abundance gfx]{[X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plots of the elements in study. The red triangles and the blue circles represent the stars with and without planets respectively.

Each element is identified in the upper right corner of the respective plot and the cutoff temperature is indicated in the lower right corner when appropriate. The black circle, cross, square and star correspond to HD209458, HD147513, HD66428 and HD142, respectively.}
\label{xfefeh1}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{xfefeh1} illustrate the plots of the studied species abundance relative to iron with [Fe/H]. The blue circles and the red triangles represent the stars with and without planets, respectively. The red dashed lines target the solar value. The identification of each element is located in the upper right corner of the respective plot. The cutoff temperature is indicated when appropriate. The black circle, cross, square and star correspond to HD209458, HD147513, HD66428 and HD142, respectively. These four stars will be analysed separately in subsection \ref{anomaly}.

We also did the same [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plots only for stars with $T_{eff}=T_\odot\pm$200 K (Fig. \ref{xfefeh2}). These plots allow us to have a more accurate picture of the trends and differences among the two groups of stars: in a differential analysis like this one, the closer the star temperature is to the solar temperature, the more accurate, in average, the derived abundance is. We hope that these latter figures help to uncover some hidden trend or a particular trend related to solar type stars, as they have much less scatter than the ones in Fig. \ref{xfefeh1}.

Each element is identified in the upper right corner of the respective plot.}
\label{xfefeh2}
\end{figure}
%We have also compared our work with \citet{Bensby-2003} and \citet{Reddy-2003} in order to test the consistency of our results against two general studies of chemical abundances in F/G/K main sequence stars of the solar neighbourhood. We did not found any significative differences. 

We did not found any differences between the stars with and without planets for a given [Fe/H] value. The exceptions are restricted to the isolated cases described in subsection \ref{anomaly}. The results agree in general with previous similar studies like, for instance, \citet{Gonzalez-2001}, \citet{Takeda-2001},  \citet{Sadakane-2002}, \citet{Bodaghee-2003}, \citet{Beirao-2005}, \citet{Fischer-2005} and \citet{Gilli-2006}. This gives us confidence in our results. The reported cases of potential trends described by other authors like, for instance, \citet{Sadakane-2002} for vanadium, \citet{Bodaghee-2003} for V, Mn, Co and Ti, \citet{Gilli-2006} for V, Co, Mg and Al and \citet{Robinson-2006} for Si and Ni were not found.  %In the case of Vanadium, however, we must note that the [V/Fe] plots only shows the results for T > 5300 K. This does not allow us to draw any strong conclusion.

We have also identified what seems to be a smaller group of stars that has a systematic average overabundance of $\sim$ 0.1 0.2 dex and spans from [Fe/H] values of -0.85 to -0.1 dex in the Fig. \ref{xfefeh1} plots of Si, TiI, ScII and Mg. This feature becomes even clearer in Fig. \ref{xfefeh2}. The group might be a different population of stars, originating from the thick disk of the galaxy (e.g. \citeauthor{Bensby-2003} \citeyear{Bensby-2003}; \citeauthor{Fuhrmann-2004} \citeyear{Fuhrmann-2004}). This will be the object of further investigation in a future work. We will not pursue this matter for now. 




%We will do a detailed analysis of the results of each element, in the following subchapters, and compare them with results from other studies.



%\citet{Gilli-2006}, hereafter GIL, have recently made an abundance determination with the same species of our work. It will be very interesting to compare her work to ours. It will also be interesting to confront our results to those of  \citet{Bodaghee-2003} (hereafter BOD). They have studied the same refractory elements as we did. Some of the elements that were analysed here had their abundances determined by \citet{Gonzalez-2001}, \citet{Takeda-2001},  \citet{Sadakane-2002}, \citet{Beirao-2005} and \citet{Fischer-2005}, hereafter GON, TAK, SAD, BEI and FIS, respectively. 

%We have also compared our work with \citet{Bensby-2003} and \citet{Reddy-2003}, hereafter BEN and RED respectively, in order to test the consistency of our results against two general studies of chemical abundances in F/G/K main sequence stars of the solar neighbourhood.



%\subsection {Silicon}

%The [Si/Fe] value decreases until [Fe/H] $\sim -0.3$. Then it remains constant at solar value for $[Fe/H] \gtrsim - 0.3$ dex. We can see a possible different population of stars with an abundance of $\sim 0.2$ dex, in a region of [Fe/H] ranging from -0.85 to -0.3 dex. The hypothetic sub group seems more differentiated in FIGB. However, this might be due only to dispersion.

%The results of SAD,BOD,FIS and GIL are similar to ours in general. All results of GON suffer from heavy scattering. However, for Si, they seem to follow the same trends of our result. BEN and RED have also obtained similar results. However, SAD and RED have obtained slightly higher abundances ($\gtrsim$ 0.05 dex) in the plateau region, but SAD has analysed only 12 stars. The population that we refer in the last paragraph might be a thick disk population, according to BEN and \citet{Fuhrmann-2004}, but this is not clear. This will be studied in a future work. 

%\subsection{Titanium}

%The [Ti/Fe] decreases until [Fe/H] reaches $\sim -0.1$ dex, at the solar value. Then it settles there for the remainder of the [Fe/H] range. In the plot of TiII the decrease seems to go to $\sim -0.2$ dex at the solar value, but TiII has more scatter in this region than Ti. Although it is not very clear, it seems to exist a different population of stars in the region from -0.85 to -0.2. This is more evident in FIGB.  %The mentioned decrease of [X/Fe] changes in FIGB for TiII and settles in $\sim -0.2$ at the solar value. 

%A similar behaviour in titanium trends is found in the studies of SAD, BOD, GIL and BEN. The results of GON are too scattered but they seem to follow the same trends. However, the plateau region in BOD and FIS seem to be slightly below the solar value and in SAD slightly above ($\pm$0.05 dex). The observed trend in FIS is different from anyone else: it has a continuously decreasing trend throughout all [Fe/H] range. In RED we observe a decreasing trend but the slope is almost flat and the [Ti/Fe] values are somewhat lower than ours in general. 


%\subsection{Scandium}

%There are lots of scatter in FIGA for the Sc plot and  we will not use it. In the [ScII/Fe] figure we can see a very slow decrease in the the abundance until [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.2. Then it remains constant at the solar value for -0.2 $\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim$ 0.2. There is an increase of [ScII/Fe] for [Fe/H] $\gtrsim 0.2$ dex. Again, there seems to exist a population with an overabundance of Sc in the range -0.85 to 0.2, but this might be a scatter effect. In FIGB it is possible to analyse the [Sc/Fe] plot. Here, there is a clear downward trend from the lower metallicities up to [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.2 dex. Then it settles at solar value and increases slightly from the solar [Fe/H] value toward higher metallicities.

%The results of SC, BOD and GIL does not seem to agree with our results. The results are similar for [Fe/H]$\lesssim$ 0.2, but then we observe an increase of the abundance with [Fe/H] and they don't. However, BOD suggests that there might be an upswing for iron rich star, but it is not conclusive due to scattering. This upswing is also present in GIL plots but it is elusive. Our figures suggest a much more evident trend. RED has similar results to ours, but for [Fe/H]$\lesssim$0.0.

%\subsection{Calcium}

%Calcium has an uniform downward trend in the entire metallicity range. It begins at abundances of $\sim 0.3$ dex and ends at [Ca/Fe] values of $\sim -0.1$, going through the solar value at solar [Fe/H]. There seems to exist a plateau for solar abundance values in the region of metallicity from -0.2 to 0.2 dex. This is more evident in FIGB.

%The trends obtained for calcium are similar to the ones found by GON, SAD, BOD and GIL. However, the abundances obtained by GIL seem to be systematically lower than ours. RED and BEN results are similar to our own.

%\subsection{Manganese}

%An uniform increasing trend is observed from [Mn/Fe] values of $\sim$ -0.1 to 0.1 dex. FIGB suggests a plateau to [Fe/H] $\gtrsim 0.2$ dex. 

%There is a good agreement between our results and those of SAD, BOD and GIL. 
%BOD suggests the existence of different metallicities for stars with and without planets at lower metallicities. Our work did not find any difference among the two samples. %RED obtained similar results to ours.


%\subsection {Chromium}

%The chromium abundances are constant around the solar value. The scatter is very small. 

%The results of SAD, BOD and GIL are similar to ours. However, there is a slight systematic difference in the results of BOD and GIL: The former has a slight underabundance and the latter has a slight overabundance relative to the solar value ($\pm$ 0.05 dex). The results of BEN and RED are very similar to ours.

%\subsection {Vanadium}

%[V/Fe] values are more or less constant around $\sim 0.1$ for [Fe/H] $\lesssim$ 0.2 dex. We should note that the vanadium abundances were impossible to read if we have not removed the cooler stars (see subsection (\ref{uncertain})). There is an increasing trend in the [V/Fe] for [Fe/H] $\gtrsim 0.2$ dex. In FIGB, the vanandium abundance values are constant around the solar value. %There seems to exist a different population with a slightly higher abundance for [Fe/H] between -0.85 and -0.2. 
%We also observe a sharp increase around [Fe/H] $\sim$ 0.2 dex to [V/Fe] $\sim$ 0.1 and a plateau for [Fe/H] $\gtrsim$ 0.2 dex. 

%Our results for vanadium differ from BOD and GIL. Although the general trend is similar, they show that there is a clear and systematic underabundance for planet host stars when compared to the non-planet group ($\sim$ 0.1 dex). Both groups say this might be due to the negative slope of [V/Fe] with $T_{eff}$ or due to NLTE effects. 
%On the other hand, SAD reports that the planet host stars have an overabundance relative to the field stars. We did not find any difference whatsoever in the abundances of our samples. This might confirm the erroneous origin of the abundance disagreement. However, we must strongly note that the [V/Fe] plots only shows the results for T > 5300 K. This does not allow us to draw any strong conclusion. %The results of RED are similar to ours but with a slight systematic underabundance.

%\subsection {Cobalt}

%Cobalt has a large scatter throughout the entire metallicity range. The abundance values decrease until it reaches [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.3 dex. Then, the [Co/Fe] ratio remains constant around the solar value until [Fe/H] reaches the solar metallicity. There is a slow increasing trend toward higher metallicities. In FIGB, the abundance is constant around $\sim 0.05$ dex until it reaches [Fe/H] $\sim -0.3$, where it decreases toward the solar value. Then it slowly increases when [Fe/H] $\gtrsim$ 0.1 dex.

%The general trends observed by SAD, BOD and GIL are present in our plots. 
%However, we do not see any difference between the two star samples, as reported by BOD and GIL. All abundance determinations, including ours, have considerable scatter. It is thus difficult to draw any strong conclusion from the analysis. %The values obtained by RED are similar to ours.


%\subsection{Niquel}

%The [Ni/Fe] value remains at solar value until [Fe/H] $\sim$ 0.1 dex. Then it slowly increases from this value toward higher metallicities until it reaches [Ni/Fe] $\sim 0.1$. Niquel abundances have a very low dispersion.

%We note a good agreement with the results of SAD and FIS. Altough BOD, GIL and RED report similar trends, their results have an  abundance slightly below ours in the plateau region ($\sim$ -0.05 dex). BEN reports results similar to ours.



%\subsection{Sodium}

%Sodium abundance values decrease until they reach the solar value at [Fe/H] $\sim -0.3$. Then they remain constant in a metallicity region from -0.3 to 0.2. The abundance has an increasing trend for [Fe/H] $\gtrsim$ 0.2. 

%A similar behaviour was found by SAD and RED. The results of GON, BEI, FIS, GIL and BEN have the same trends as our work, but they have much more dispersion and [Na/Fe] reaches relatively high negatives values ($\gtrsim$ - 0.2 dex) at solar metallicity. Neither author mentions the existence of a plateau in the intermediate [Fe/H] region. 

%\subsection {Magnesium}

%The [Mg/Fe] value has a decreasing trend until [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.1. Then it remains constant at solar value. We should note that possible existence of a different population of stars with a slight overabundance in the range -0.75 $\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\gtrsim$ -0.2.

%The trends obtained are similar to those of GON, SAD, BEI and GIL. 
%We did not observe any difference among stars with and without planets, as reported by GIL for the high metallicity end of the sample. %BEN and RED results also agree with ours. The referred different population appears only in the BEN study as a thick disk population. This possibility will be explored further in a future work.

%\subsection {Aluminium}

%Aluminium abundance decreases until [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.3. The it remains constant at solar value. Again, the FIGB suggest the existence of a different population with a slightly higher abundance (that is not seen in FIGA), where it spans in a metallicity range from -0.85 to -0.1. 

%Our results are similar to those obtained by SAD, BEI and GIL. The results of GON have too much scatter to make a meaningful comparative analysis. BEN and RED results are similar to ours. Again, the star population that we have referred before appears in the work of BEN as a thick disk population. However, the study of this population is out of the scope of this work.

\subsection{Metallicity Anomalies in Planet Host Stars}
\label {anomaly}
In our analysis we have found some planet host stars with unusual high or low values of abundance when compared to stars with similar [Fe/H]. We will analyse each case in a different paragraph. 

The star HD209458 has very high overabundance values when compared to stars with similar [Fe/H]. This can be observed in Fig. \ref{xfefeh1} on the plots of TiI, Ca, CrI, V ($\thickapprox$+0.3 dex) and Ni ($\thickapprox$+0.15 dex). However, this star has a RW slope greater than 0.4 dex for Ni  and, therefore, the derived abundance values might be incorrect (see subsection \ref{testpar}). Consequently, we cannot conclude anything.  %\textcolor{red}{In some elements, the abundance difference is of the same order of magnitude of the standard error and therefore the result for this plot is not conclusive, even if it agrees with other elements - discutir com Nuno}. Interestingly, it has a very low value of [Mn/Fe] when comparted to the average value at the same [Fe/H] ($\thickapprox$-0.2 dex). 

The overabundance values observed in HD147513 are very similar to the ones of HD209458 but they are somewhat lower for the same plots except Ni, in which it has a normal abundance value. Nevertheless, it remains isolated from other stars of similar [Fe/H]. The value of [Mn/Fe] is also lower than the average value at the same [Fe/H]. We didn't find any bias for this star.

The huge overabundance value of HD66428 ($\thickapprox$0.4 dex) in the MgI plot is a mystery. This star has normal values for every other element. However, the abundance of MgI has a huge dispersion (rms = 0.46 dex). This means that we cannot conclude anything. Despite that, we have not found any bias for this star.

The star HD142 is a very interesting case: it has a very high underabundance in the plots of Mg, Al ($\thickapprox$-0.3 dex), Ca ($\thickapprox$-0.2 dex) and a slight underabundance in Si, ScII, Mn, CrI, V, Co and Ni. Curiously, it has a very slight overabundance in TiI and TiII. CrII has a high overabundance value: this implies that the result for chromium is not conclusive - we have two contradictory values for the same element. The slope RW for Ni has a reasonably high value of 0.13 (see subsection \ref{testpar}). Therefore, the underabundance results for this star are inconclusive. Due to the high temperature of this star ($T_{eff}=6403$ K), the abundance analysis of this star might suffer from NLTE effects, which might explain the oscillation of the abundance values.

We have not found any abundance anomalies in the stars previously described in the literature: the underabundance of Ca in HD209100 derived by \citet{Bodaghee-2003} was found to be well within the rms values for that element and the overabundance of Mg and Al in the host star HD168746 described by \citet{Sadakane-2002}, \citet{Laws-2003} and \citet{Gilli-2006}  was not found. In a limited search through the literature we have not seen any reference to the stars with abundance anomalies found in the present study.

\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

We have derived the abundances of 12 elements (silicon, calcium, titanium, scandium, manganese, chromium, vanadium, cobalt, niquel, sodium, magnesium and aluminium) in a detailed and homogeneous spectral analysis from a catalogue of 451 stars of the HARPS 'high precision' GTO planet search program, from which 66 planets are known to harbour planetary companions. Comparison studies with other authors were made to assure the consistency of our results. The [X/H] distributions as well as the plots of [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] were analysed to compare the trends of stars with and without planets. 

\section {Conclusions}

Our concluding remarks are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 
\item We derived abundance values with an high precision and low dispersion. However, we must take the results for Co and Al with some reservation: the derived abundances have a non-negligible bias with temperature, as seen in section \ref{}. We consider that the 
\item We confirm that there is an overabundance of metallicity in planet host stars, common to all species, as expected from the results in previous works. The results suggest that the efficiency of planetary formation correlates strongly with the metal content of the host star: the probability of finding a star with giant planets is greater in stars with a high [X/H]. This has implications on the models of planetary formation: the results favour the core accretion model and might help constrain the conditions of formation of planetary bodies.
\item We did not found any different trends in the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plots between stars with and without planets, in agreement with previous studies.The stars that harbour planetary companions simply seem to be in the high metallicity tail of the distribution, following the same trends as the stars without planets. This might favour the primordial origin as the preferred cause for the observed high metallicities in planet host stars. %However, we should not forget that the conclusions that one can infer from the analysis of the plots of Ti, ScI, CrII and V are limited due to the fact that only stars with $T_{eff}$> $T_{cutoff}$ were used. However, in the case of titanium, scandium and chromium we have derived the abundances of both the neutral atom and the first ion of these elements and, therefore, this limitation has little effect.  %Nevertheless, a general agreement was achieved with both previous studies on abundances of stars with extrasolar planets and studies on abundances of stars of the galactic disk. 
\item We have only found one case where the pollution scenario might be important (see section \ref{planets}): HD147513 has an overabundance in some species and no bias has been found. This particular case needs to be investigated in a future work. The analysis of HD142, HD66428 and HD209458 is inconclusive. 

\end{itemize}

\section {Future Work}

In the future we hope to continue our work in the following directions:

\begin{itemize}
 
\item Investigate the galactic chemical evolution of the studied elements. This can lead to a better understanding on the different origins of the elements and their trends with metallicity (and with time). 

\item Extend the abundance study to the volatile elements and investigate the trends of abundance with the condensation temperature of the species. This will allow a study on differential accrection, where we could see if some elements are more abundant than others. The outcome of this analysis might favour one of the two hypothesis for the observed anomalous metallicity in planet host stars: the primordial origin or the external pollution process (see section \ref{others}). 

\item Investigate the relation of metallicity with the orbital parameters (eccentricity, orbital period) and minimum masses of the planetary bodies.

\item Confirm and investigate the stars with abundance anomalies discussed in subsection \ref{anomaly}.

\item Explore the possibility of the existence and origin of a different population of stars with higher metallicity in the region of [Fe/H] < 0 that appear more clearly in the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plots of some species (e.g. Si, TiI, ScII, Mg). We speculate that this population might originate from the thick disk of the galaxy and we would like to explore this possibility doing a kinematic analysis on the stars of the sample to confirm that hypothesis. 

\end{itemize}

%\section {Introduction}

%In this section we will make a brief discriptions of the technical details, capabilites and ...  of the HARPS spectrograph. For a detailed description of the basic physics, equations and tools behind the operation of a general spectrograph, the prospective reader can consult, for instance, chapter 3 of Gray (2005).

%The scientific proposal for HARPS was made in 1999, one year after the decision to build it, following a flurry of exoplanet discoveries that motivated the need for a more potent, precise and dedicated instrument (sci proposal HARPS 1999). The main objective was to reach the 1m/s threshhold for detecting lower mass planets by Radial Velocity with unparalelled accuracy. The %HARPS spectrograph was not only made for quality but also for quantity. The observational challenge lied now on observing as many planet host systems as possible in the five year span of the program, in order to have sufficient quality data to do a statistical treatment of all the planetary parameters possible with this technique: distance to host star, minimum mass of the planet, period, excentricity. Moreover, HARPS high spectral resolution (115.000) and S/N ratio has permitted to achieve never seen before spectra of the host stars. From all this data, we hope to reach a better understanding of the physical processes underlying planetary formation. This spectra could also be used to statistically analyse the planet host stars parameters with those of field dwarfs, like, for instance, abundances from several elements, light, volatile and refractory, effective temperatures, spectroscopig $log g$,etc. What are the possible relations among all these parameters, exoplants reserachers asked to HARPS... 

%What do we need to achieve these goals? We need a high resolution spectrograph, with a large spectral window, a very stable velocity reference and a fine data reduction process. The technique used to reach this high precision is based on a two fiber fed echelle spectrograph, one fibre for the star and the other iluminating a Thorium-Argon lamp used as reference, allowing the follow up of any instrumental drift. The stellar and reference velocities are calculated by a cross correlation function of both sources. 

%\section{limitations}

%How can we distinguish the motions of the photosphere due to pulsation and/or stellar activity related to the rotation of star spots or convective inhomogeneities with the motions due to the planets proper? A quantification of these effects can be achieved by comparing the weighted radial velocity dispersion with the typical stellar parameters (spectral type, rotation, magnetic activity) similar to the star being observed. The amplitude of radial velocity variations provoked by instrinsic phenomena may reach some tens of $m/s$ and can therefore inhibit or confuse planet detection. To give an idea, Jupiter's perturbation on the Sun velocity is  ~ 12.5 $m/s$.
%The present instrumentation accuracy may be limited either by photon noise or by instrumental errors. When aiming at $1m/s$ we must be aware of both sources of errors. 
%Considering the photon noise limit, the possible RV precision depends on three factors: the measured flux $S$, the overall spectral resolution $R$ and the observed spectral range $\lambda\lambda$, according to Hatzes and Cochran 1992 (n consigo encontrar artigo!!! 
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{1}{\sigma v_r}\propto S^{0.5}\lambda^{0.5}R^{1.5}
%\end{equation}
%The best way to increase the RV precision is to increase as much as possible the resolution of the spectrograph. Unfortunately this leads to large instrument size, without the use of adaptative optics or image slicers, which were not adequate to HARPS. The solution was to install the largest echelle grating possible. The ideia was to increase the resolution to the point where the stellar spectral lines start to be resolved. The comprimise for $R$ was set at ~ 100.000. Even at this high resolution, slit losses remain below 50\%. 

%\section{Comparing HARPS with other spectrographs}
%How does HARPS spectrograph fare agains other similar instruments? In the following table, we can observe a comparison table of instrument overall eficiencies. The coefficient $Q_{night}/Q_{HARPS}$ represents the efficiency of the instrument to reach a given photon-noise precision per observing night, compared to HARPS, taking into account the telescope size, the spectral bandwidth, resolution and transmission differences between the spectrographs. The technique is ThAr lamp if the number of fibers are shown. Otherwise it's the Iodine Technique. $Q_{year}/Q_{HARPS}$ corresponds to the same value integrated over 1 year, taking into account the time allocation for planet search only. 

%As we can see, HARPS is superior to every instrument on the table, exept the VLT UVES with the FLAMES link due to its multi fibre configuration. The HARPS supremacy is even greater if we take into account the efficiency coeficient per year that includes telescope time for planet search of each instrument. 

%The improvement in the precision of RV measurments from 5-10 $m/s$ down to 1 $m/s$, will largely contribute to remove biases in the detection of extra solar planets.  This will permit the detection of very light giant planets only with one tenth of the mass of saturn, although terrestrial planets should be out of reach if the 1 $m/s$ limits apply throughout the lifetime of the instrument (obviamente que nao). -- ver figura 8 se n tiver noutro sitio. 

%\section{Instument Overview}

%HARPS stands for \textbf{H}igh \textbf{A}ccuracy \textbf{R}adio \textbf{V}elocity \textbf{P}lanetary \textbf{S}earcher and is an instrument designed to measure high precision and high resolution Radial Velocities (RV). Its main goal is to reach a RV accuracy of 1 $m/s$ for slowly rotating solar type stars. This never before reached precisions enable the detection of low mass extra solar planets (a little smaller than Saturn). 
%The design of HARPS was based on previous observational programs like ELODIE and CORALIE during the past 10 years. The basic design of HARPS is very similar to these. The main advantages of HARPS are as following:
%\begin{itemize}
 %\item Greater instrument stability. The spectrograph is installed in a sealed and evacuated enclosure with low temperature. This almost completely eliminates drifts in RV due to temperature, pressure or humidity variations.
%\item Increase of S/N. The 3.6m ESA telescope on witch HARPS is installed is bigger than it's predecessors. Therefore, the S/N %ratio is better. Moreover, the resolution of the CCD is increased by a factor of two and this also permits to reduce %intrumental errors.
%\item Improvement of online data reduction. includes better corrections for instrumental effects and is faster.
%\end{itemize}

%HARPS is a fibre-fed, cross dispersed echelle spectrograph. It operates at 17$^o$C constant within  0.005$^oC$ RMS, with a pressure < 10$^{-2}mbar$. It is located in the Coude' floor of the 3.6m telescope. 
%Two fibers, an object and a reference fibre fed the spectrograph with light from the telescope and from the calibration lamps. The light is reimaged by the internal optics onto a mosaic of two 2k4 CCDs were two spectra of 72 orders are formed. The spectral region goes from 380 to 690nm. At the resolution of 115.000 each spectral element is sampled by 3.2 CCD pixels. A summary of the specs are shown below (messenger 114). 
%The optics are mounted on a 2.5m optical bench made of plated steel. The spectrograph has no moving parts and is located inside a vaccum vessel in a thermally stabilized enclosure.  
%The illumination is critical for RV precision. This is guaranteed thanks to the light scrambling properties if the optic fibres. 
%HARPS is an ordinary spectrograph. However it distinguishes itself mainly by his incredible stability:The ThAr reference is able to detect even the tiniest of instrumental drifts. Nevertheless lots of efforts was put into place to make HARPS intrinsically stable, in order to avoid any kind of second order intrumental errors. Consequently, the spectrograph operates in low vacuum since pressure variations may produce huge drifts in the order of 100m/s per mbar. The pressure was put under $10^{-2}$ mbar so that the drifts do not exceed 1m/s per day. Temperature was also controlled...When the instrumental noise produced by the thermal dilatation of the CCDs due to tiny temperature variations is removed we get dispersion values consistent with photon noise of the ThAr reference lamp. This technique can track drift variations at 0.1 $m/s$. Factors like resolution, optical efficiency, size of instrument and telescope, fiber diameter, must be balanced in order to have the smallest instrumental errors. 
%After several tests, the attained value for the HARPS precision was well below 1 $m/s$. Even on the time scale of a comission (2 weeks) we could obtain values of dispersion no greater than 1 m/s. This same level of precision was obtained even in surveys with a timescale over 4 months. At this precision level, we must count that one of the most probable sources of dispersion is the star itself (pulsations, activity, jitter). 
%The data analysis of all the accumulated observations are still being done in order to determine  which effects are limiting the precision of RV measurements. Disentangling noise and systematics from instrumental and stellar origin in not a trivial task. It needs time and lots of data. This will be very important for the preparation of the next generation instruments like CODEX on OWL telescope. 
%The best residuals obtained are as low as 0.2 m/s which indicates that with enough observations, it will be possible to detect a 3 $M_\oplus$at 1 AU. But it seems reasonable that it is possible to average out most of the perturbing effects (stellar oscilations, activity jittering...). when observing in timescales compared to the periods of these effects. 
%Efforts in the improvement of calibration with the ThAr lamps using a new HARPS made atlas with very high resolutions has enabled to reach new global uncertainties in the calibration  (RV zero point) from 0.8 m/s to 0.2-0.4 m/s. 

%\section{Other error sources}

%The most obvious error source is photon noise: it is the one coming from the finite number of photons collected in a stellar spectrum. The fundamental uncertainty on the RV depends both on the number of recorded photons and on the intrinsic slope of the spectrum. 
%Guiding noise is the noise that originates from changes in the fibre illumination. This is very critical. This can cause spurious RV variations. With proper software to monitor the centering of the fibre at the middle of the stellar image the guiding noise contributes no more than 0.3 m/s to the global dispersion.
%Stellar Oscilation Noise. Solar type stars show p mode oscilations with periods of a few minutes and amplitudes of a few m/s. However some of these signals can superimpose. The present strategy regarding this noise is to integrate over a few characteristic periods to average out these effets as much as possible. This maintains this noise below 1 m/s.
%Stellar activity related jitter. Magnetic phenomena at the surface of solar type stars can induce RV perturbations in the order of 100 m/s. This prevents completely the use of RV tequenique to detect planetary companions. Stars in the HARPS catalogue are chosen for showing low chromospheric activity and slow rotation. to ensure that these effects stay below a few m/s. Hopefully, the binning of data points over the stellar rotation will permit to average out these effects, but this is still on an experimental phase.






%\section{The Telescope}
%The ESO La Silla 3.6m telescope, home of the HARPS spectrograph, is equatorially mounted. HARPS use the Cassegrain focus. A general discription of the telescope can be found here: http:\\www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/sciops/3p6/. 

%\section{Spectrograph}

%The Vaccum vessel protects the spectrograph proper from variations in temperature, pressure and humidity. Is is evacuated by a turbo molecular pump before the start of operations. The vaccum is regenerated once or twice per month. 

%The Spectograph itself is a cross dispersed echelle spectrograph, similar to UVES @ VLT. The echelle grating is operated in a quasi Littrow operation (ver). An f/2.1 parabolic mirror serves as collimator. A dioptric camera images the cross dispersed spectra side by side onto a mosaic of two 2kx4k EEV CCDs. The spectral range goes from 378 to 691 nm. All components are mounted on a stainless steel optical bench. The optical paremeters of HARPs are those of Table X.X.

%\section{Detector System}

%Harps employ a mosaic of two EEV type 44-82 CCDs. The spectral format is 4096x4096 pixels. Its properties are summarized in the following table. 

%\section {Calibration Unit}

%It provides the instrument with light for wavelength and flatfield calibration. This calibration is based on a set of Thorium-Argon and halogen lamps. The calibration fibre pair connects the calibration unit with the fibre adapter at the Cassegrain focus. 

%\section {Data reduction}

%The data reduction pipeline is a software developed by ESA which allows the reduction of the spectra in almost real time. 


%Both stray light and ghosts are present at some level, most noticeable in the blue part of the spectrum. This is due to the fabrication process of the grid itself (defects). The characteristic optical data of HARPS can be seen in Table X.X.
