# papers and astrophysics scientific work

My astrophysics papers repository.

## Dissertation thesis and first paper

My research career in Astrophysics began in 2007 when I enrolled in a master in Physics at the University of Aveiro. My research work resulted in the publication of my dissertation entitled *Abundances of elements in stars with planets* as well as my first peer reviewed research paper in Astronomy and Astrophysics magazine.

## PhD Thesis and second, third ,and fourth papers

I began my PhD in 2009 and finished in 2013. During these four years I worked within an explanet hunting team and I published two first author papers and 1 paper with an important co-authorship. My thesis work is about the relationship between the existence of planets and the parameters of M-dwarf stars and is entitled *Stellar parameters for M-dwarfs: the link to exoplanets*.

## Post-Doc and fifth paper

After my PhD I did a post-doc in Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil (2014-2015). During my stay, I published a technical paper that refines the technique first developed during my PhD, enabling its use in any spectrograph.

## Co-authorship papers

During all these years, I collaborated with different people in different groups, which resulted in 25 collaboration papers. Most papers are exoplanetary detections via radial velocities and transits.
